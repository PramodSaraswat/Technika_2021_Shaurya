                    Amy is from Glendale, California. She also has a doctorate degree in neurobiology from Harvard University, inspired by actor Mayim Bialik's own doctorate.

                    She initially was discovered by Raj and Howard as a possible match for Sheldon through an online dating service. By Sheldon's own admission, she is most like him by any standard. Like him, she has previously avoided relationships (whether romantic or otherwise is entirely unclear). She has her own apartment. She also has a five-year plan to become Mrs. Cooper. By the ninth season, Amy wants to take a breather from their relationship and naive Sheldon pushes her so she breaks-up with him. Later, the two reconcile and resume their relationship eventually moving in together. In the Season 10 finale, Sheldon asks her to marry him getting engaged in "The Proposal Proposal". The wedding was on May 12, 2018.
                <br />
                <br />
                   <h4 id="Early_Life"> Early Life</h4>
                    Amy was born to Larry and Mrs. Fowler on December 17 (as proven by Sheldon having a ticket to the premiere on THURSDAY, that being the 17th), in 1979 from Glendale, California. ("The Weekend Vortex") Her father is very quiet and in an unhappy marriage with her mother. Amy is an only child. She has a strained relationship with her mother. She was very lonely and had no friends from nursery school through to graduate school. The closest thing she had to a friend in high school was the janitor whom she regularly had lunch with until his wife found out, called Amy a "puta" (Spanish for "whore") and made her stop. Only her mother signed her high school yearbook. Mrs. Fowler also paid Amy's cousin to take her to the prom, but he used the money to buy drugs. She did attend the prom, but was only on the clean-up crew and danced with her mop. She also dressed up as Amelia Earhart in middle school.

                    After high school, Amy went to Harvard, then to graduate school, and later received a Ph.D. in neurobiology.

                    <h4 id={"Character"}>Characterisation</h4>
                    When we first met Amy, she seemed quite emotionless and forward speaking (much like Sheldon). After becoming friends with Penny and Bernadette and before and after becoming Sheldon's girlfriend, we see a new (more fun) side to Amy, where she becomes a far more friendly, loving and caring person. She also begins to appear as a voice of reason for Sheldon and teaches him things such as empathy.

              <br/><br/>      Though Amy and Sheldon are very similar, they have some notable differences. She does not, for example, share his love of Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, comic books, science-fiction, video games or trains. At first, she does not participate in wearing costumes on a whim like the guys do, though she is excited to wear a couples' costume for Halloween one year and, another time, dresses up as a Star Fleet medical officer the play doctor in order to increase Sheldon's feelings for her. Amy is more willing to socialize with others than Sheldon. While Sheldon generally refuses to accept the need for intimacy, Amy appears to desire the kinds of friendship she was denied as a child. Unlike Sheldon, Amy is very much willing to make fiends with people and also makes genuine attempts to get along with other people.<br/><br/> She is capable of acknowledging that she is part of a group, as shown in "The Zazzy Substitution" when she uses the phrase "my colleagues and I." She also finds people of the opposite sex attractive, although she is initially unable to understand her physical desire for Penny's ex-boyfriend Zack Johnson until it is examined by Sheldon and her.

                    Additionally, she has less of a problem with physical human contact than Sheldon, as seen in "The 21-Second Excitation" when she, without hesitation, attempted to engage in "harmless experimentation with lesbianism" with Penny, in "The Love Car Displacement" when she offered Penny to share a room with her and in "The Cohabitation Formulation" when she hugged Penny to comfort her, when Penny got upset over Leonard finding a new girlfriend (Priya). In "The Agreement Dissection", she, albeit under the influence of alcohol, kissed Penny on the mouth and later did the same to Sheldon the same night.

                    <br/><br/>      Amy and Sheldon know how each other thinks because when it comes to the game "Counterfactuals", only they know the correct answers whose logic is very obvious to both of them. Other people like Leonard do not see how they obtain their answers. It's also likely that other people who have IQs would not be able to see how they obtain their answers.

                    <br/><br/>      Amy has a habit of being very narcissistic to the point of being callous; when she was asked to be Bernadette's maid of honor, she consistently behaved like the upcoming wedding would be her special day and that she outshone Bernadette, an opinion she never missed an opportunity to voice. When Howard and Bernadette contemplated delaying the wedding, Amy lamented because it wasn't what she wanted, disregarding that it was not essentially her wedding. What differentiates her narcissism from Sheldon's is that she isn't so self-obsessed that she feels obligated to make other people's lives feel completely insignificant to her own. There are also several occasions, far more than Sheldon, where she recognizes what people are feeling and why.

                    <br/><br/>     Amy is very blunt and says things that make others feel awkward, though she has developed into a very loyal friend to the girls and a devoted girlfriend to Sheldon. She has low self-esteem, the main reason why she always put up with Sheldon when no one else wants to date her. Until "The Opening Night Excitation", she also was a virgin and so was Sheldon. Sheldon was not in a hurry to lose his virginity, but Amy was considering it for a long time before they coupled. She is also allergic to avocados and likes Chaucer, medieval poetry, old French movies and writes "Little House on the Prairie" fan fiction.

                    In Amy's first appearances, she seemed to be rather serious and not very full of emotion like Sheldon; however, upon becoming Sheldon's girlfriend, her personality transitions to that of a joyful and laid back woman with a sense of fun.
             <h4 id="Family">Family</h4>
                    The first member of Amy's family who has been seen on-screen was her mother. She was first seen via webcam in "The Desperation Emanation" (S4E5) when Amy asked Sheldon to meet her when she got him to pretend he's her boyfriend, which he was reluctant to do though he did enjoy participating in the prank.

         <br/><br/>           Mrs. Fowler never reappeared again in the show until "The Bow Tie Asymmetry" (S11E24) where she was revealed to be quite nasty.

                    Amy's father, Larry had been mentioned thrice, but there had never been any information given about him. He first appeared in "The Bow Tie Asymmetry" at his daughter's wedding and wasn't able to speak since his wife always did for him. He also appeared to be in a loveless marriage with her and even said "Thank you" to Penny for reprimanding his wife.

                    <br/><br/>       Amy has no siblings, making her an only child, though she has mentioned to have a few cousins and a couple of aunts and an uncle.

                    In "The Isolation Permutation", she mentioned that a cousin of hers named Irene and her entire bridal party was killed in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before Irene's wedding. She mentions in "The Weekend Vortex" that she has an Aunt Flora whose 93rd birthday party she planned to attend with Sheldon, but she is never seen. It was also revealed that she had a cousin named William (Amy's Cousin) who was somehow ground to death in an accident at a pepper factory.

                    <br/><br/>      She also has an uncle that smokes a pipe. In "The Cooper/Kripke Inversion" Amy had a monkey in her smoking study that had taken up pipe smoking and he reminded Amy of her uncle. Her mother paid one of her cousins to take her to prom; however, he used the money to buy drugs as revealed in "The Pulled Groin Extrapolation." Her mother kept her in "The Sin Closet" when she was bad when she was young and Amy did visit her for Thanksgiving dinner in "The Platonic Permutation".

                    Amy also has an aunt in Modesto and one in Bakersfield.

                    <br/><br/>      In "The Bachelor Party Corrosion", Amy reveals that she has an Aunt Doe and an Aunt Florence. According to Amy, neither women seemed to get along with each other for reasons that aren't familiar to her.
                    <h4 id="Trivia">Trivia</h4>
                    Dr. Mayim Bialik, the actress who portrays Amy, was first mentioned in "The Bat Jar Conjecture", when Leonard, Howard, and Rajesh Koothrappali discussed who would replace Sheldon on the team for The Physics Bowl Quiz and Raj suggested "You know who’s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV’s "Blossom". She got a PhD in neuroscience or something." This reference occurred about 3 years before Mayim joined the show. Amy's profession as a neurobiologist is a reference to the actress who portrays her, who actually graduated with a Ph.D. in neuroscience from UCLA in 2008. Dr. Mayim Bialik herself revealed in an interview that the writers made Amy a neurobiologist after she was cast on the show.
                    Her birthday is December 17 ("The Opening Night Excitation").
                    Amy has a Ph. D. in Neurobiology. Sheldon revealed this fact in "The Roommate Transmogrification". She believes neurobiology is superior to both Microbiology and Theoretical Physics just like Sheldon in his field.
                    Amy is 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) tall [1], the height of Dr Mayim Bialik.
                    Ever since "The 21-Second Excitation", Amy considers Penny her best friend and claims that their menses are synchronized. She even calls her "bestie" or BFF, which Penny is now used to. By the eleventh season, Penny soon realizes that Amy really IS her best friend.
                    Amy becomes constipated when traveling.
                    Amy wears menstrual pads all the time to avoid "surprises".
                    Prior to "The 21-Second Excitation", the closest she ever had to a slumber party was a night she spent at a hospital with a Vietnamese girl after having her tonsils removed. The girl did not survive the night, but "up till then, it was kinda fun".
                    Amy is pseudo-engaged to a Saudi prince named Faisal. She met him at a fundraising trip to his country. He funds her laboratory. In return, she has a place to stay in Riyadh Saudi Arabia during the winter.
                    Amy is very prone to night terrors though this has not been seen with Shamy living together.
                    Amy has volunteered for scientific experiments in which orgasms are achieved by stimulating the pleasure center of the brain; hers was stimulated at least 128 times, in an unspecified number of experiments.
                    She claims to have perfected many "tension-relieving techniques for ladies" over the years.
                    She has an electric toothbrush she uses for masturbation named "Gerard".
                    She claims Sheldon to be the most fun person she knows.
                    In "The Zazzy Substitution", Sheldon claims that Amy is the most similar person to him by any standard.
                    She was in the Cub Scouts for two years until they discovered that she was a girl.
                    The closest thing to a friend Amy had in high school was the janitor with whom she regularly lunched with, until his wife found out and called her a "puta" (Spanish for whore) and made her stop. She also claimed that she had no friends in kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, college, and during her advanced college studies.
                    Her first appearance is in "The Lunar Excitation", which happens to be the final episode of season 3 and the final appearance of former regular cast member Leslie Winkle (except for a "The Celebration Experimentation" cameo).
                    She can play the harp, as shown in "The Infestation Hypothesis" and claimed to know only two songs: a bossanova standard and the Diff'rent Strokes theme song. Although since then, she seems to have learned other songs as well, playing "The Girl from Ipanema" in "The Infestation Hypothesis", R.E.M.'s "Everybody Hurts" in "The Isolation Permutation", and Bon Jovi's "Wanted Dead or Alive}}" in "The Werewolf Transformation". She also played at Leonard and Penny's vow renewal.
                    She has her own secret language, Op, formed by appending -op to consonants, i.e., "pack a bag" becomes "pop a cop kop a bop a gop".
                    She wears hand-me-downs from her grandmother, except for a pair of leopard-spotted panties she bought from Victoria's Secret.
                    Unlike Sheldon, Amy has no interest in model trains, science fiction or video games.
                    Due to her lack-of-friends situation in high school, the only person who signed her high school yearbook was her mom, who wrote: "Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom".
                    Amy has hinted that she may be bisexual, or bi-curious, especially around Penny. During "The Robotic Manipulation", she asked Penny whether she is a homosexual after Penny complimented her hair, and later attempted to engage "in harmless lesbian experimentation" with her during the girls' slumber party. In "The Pulled Groin Extrapolation", she told Penny that Penny would have a better shot with her than Leonard. She also enthusiastically defends Penny whenever anyone insults her. She also said that there wasn't a hair on her body that she wouldn't mind her cutting. And she didn't seem to mind when she misunderstand that Penny was carrying Sheldon's baby
                    When she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes by just using nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.
                    Amy's apartment number is 314. Surely, that is no accident since the number represents the number of pi, which is roughly 3.14. It also happens to be Albert Einstein's birth month and birth day which is March 14. It was also the day that Stephan Hawking (who appeared several times in the series) died.
                    Ever since "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition", she and Sheldon officially became a couple. They are each other's first boyfriend and girlfriend respectively.
                    Amy thinks comic books are "lame-o" initially; however, this feeling changes in "The Bakersfield Expedition", wherein she becomes enamored with them.
                    She used to play Travel Twister alone to spend her evenings.
                    She is the co-creator of the game "Counterfactuals" with Sheldon. Surprisingly, despite it being a brain-teaser type of game, only the two of them could play, as even a genius like Leonard failed miserably in the game. Understanding the concept of the game reveals how much Sheldon and Amy think alike.
                    She had an agreement with her mother to go on a date at least once a year, in return for her mother's silence on the matter and being able to occasionally use her mother's George Foreman grill that "seals in the flavor without the fat". She then signed up on a dating site that matched her with Sheldon. Amy also had a similar agreement about shaving her legs.
                    Amy has been a Maid of Honor twice in her life. The first one was for her Cousin Irene's wedding, though it did not materialize when Irene died of carbon monoxide poisoning before the wedding. The second was during Howard and Bernadette's wedding in "The Countdown Reflection".
                    Despite her many similarities with Sheldon, she thinks he has a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic, as according to "The Infestation Hypothesis".
                    She revealed in "The Speckerman Recurrence" that among her nicknames during high school were "Gorilla-Fingers Fowler" and "Fuzzy-Fingers Fowler", a result of her having hairy knuckles from using her hand lotion that her bullies had spiked with Rogaine.
                    She does not mind being Penny's cellmate should they be caught for breaking the law.
                    According to Bill Prady through Twitter, Amy is a fan of Downton Abbey.
                    Amy is shown to be more interested in physical contacts and social conventions than Sheldon is.
                    In "The Vacation Solution", Amy mentions that she has been in the field of neurobiology for 12 years, indicating she began in 2000, as the episode was filmed in 2012.
                    Amy had a make-believe boyfriend named Arman, the miniature horse breeder, whom she used to tell her family when they asked her about her boyfriend. The lie was discovered after Amy said that "Woodstock" was where they met.
                    She revealed in "The Weekend Vortex" that, as a child, she used to toss coins into "wishing wells", wishing for friends. Eventually, she started making trick shots, just to keep the activity interesting.
                    Amy is a bad liar, just like Sheldon.
                    Mayim Bialik's (the actress who plays Amy) first name can be anagrammed as "I'm Amy".
                    Sheldon revealed that Amy is allergic to penicillin in "The Shiny Trinket Maneuver".
                    Amy, along with Penny, Sheldon, Raj, and Leonard, were all ordained as ministers in order to wed Howard and Bernadette in "The Countdown Reflection".
                    In the "The Pulled Groin Extrapolation", Leonard is Amy's date to a wedding reception. The two actors' characters also dated in one episode of Dr. Mayim Bialik's series Blossom.
                    On July 19, 2012, Dr. Mayim Bialik received her first ever Emmy nomination in the "Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series" category for her portrayal of Amy.
                    Just like Kaley Cuoco's leg injury back in season 4, the writers did not include Dr. Mayim Bialik's injured hand into Amy's story line.
                    Bernadette, Raj, Leonard, Penny and Amy are the only characters of the social group/main cast whose parents have both been seen on-camera - Sheldon's father died when Sheldon was a child, Howard's father abandoned him and his mother when Howard was eleven, Stuart's mother and father have been mentioned and are both alive, Emily's father has been mentioned and it is not known if he is dead or alive and there has been no appearance or mention of Emily's mother or Leslie's mother and father to date.
                    Amy had a cousin named William (Amy's Cousin) who was somehow ground to death in an accident at a pepper factory.
                    Among Amy's choices for couple Halloween costumes with Sheldon include "Blossom and Joey" from Dr. Mayim Bialik's previous television series.
                    Although relatively dismissive of franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars, Amy is not afraid to affiliate herself with related concepts, and will do so to keep her relationship with Sheldon on an even keel; in "The Tangible Affection Proof", she openly entertains the idea of sharing in his passion for either franchise as part of her role as Sheldon's girlfriend.
                    Amy does not object to the concept of deities, but disbelieves that they would take attendance.
                    Amy is not so blind to her appreciation of Penny as not to recognize her faults in intelligence and her acting career.
                    In "The Scavenger Vortex" Amy displays her love of Neil Diamond music as she bonds over his music with Howard.
                    She is the only main character to have been kissed by Sheldon.
                    On March 11, 2014, Dr. Mayim Bialik (Amy) visited "The Talk" and was interviewed by Sara Gilbert (Leslie Winkle). They both appeared in "The Lunar Excitation"; Amy's first appearance and Leslie's last except for one brief cameo.
                    Leslie and Amy on "The Talk".

                    Amy is also allergic to avocados as described in season 8 episode 3.
                    Amy can't ride horses due to her hips being unable to bend her legs farther than 22 degrees; however, she once rode a very thin pony, but went flying off when it hit a bump. The latter could have possibly led to the former.
                    She could have been named after actress Farrah Fawcett.
                    The four episodes in which Amy appeared but was not listed in the main cast are: "The Lunar Excitation", "The Robotic Manipulation", "The Zazzy Substitution" and "The Desperation Emanation".
                    While Penny has seen her and Sheldon kiss, Howard, Bernadette, and Mike (Bernadette's dad) have seen them, or more specifically, Sheldon, do something "naughty" to the other. In "The Thanksgiving Decoupling" (S07E09) an intoxicated Sheldon slaps Amy's butt after saying to the others with a big smile, "Ain't she great?" Dr. Mayim Bialik has stated in her blog that the "Thanksgiving booty smacking" wasn't supposed to be in the scene and in one take; Jim (Sheldon) hit her lower back instead of her buttocks, which left a mark.
                    Emily is the only character of the entire main cast who remain unknown of whether she has any siblings or not (Leonard, Penny, Sheldon and Stuart each have one brother and one sister, Howard has a half-brother, Leslie has one sister and Bernadette and Raj each have five siblings (Raj: 3 brothers and 2 sisters; Bernadette: Four unidentified siblings (brothers/sisters) and a brother)). Amy had no siblings at her wedding and when she meet Missy she said she always wanted a sister.
                    Unlike other people (Apart from blood relatives), Sheldon has no problem or phobia of Amy touching him.
                    Unlike Sheldon, Amy attended middle school and high school, since Sheldon began college at the age of 11, right after leaving elementary school.
                    Amy Farrah Fowler has low self-esteem, that is one of the main reasons why she put up with Sheldon's antics or his arrogant and egotistical attitude.
                    In November 2016, Mayim was quoted saying that Amy was still with Sheldon because she finds him enjoyable, attractive and intelligent so she is willing to put up with his quirks.
                    She used to have a water bed.
                    She has foot fungus.
                    She is right-handed, or at least when it comes to writing. Whenever she is writing, she always holds the pen in her right hand; however she might be mixed-handed, as she always writes with her right hand, but always uses her left hand to hold silverware to eat.
                    Amy has connections with both of the Wolowitz children. The first was born on her birthday and the second was named after Neil Diamond, a singer both Amy and Howard liked.
                    She wants to have 2 kids with Sheldon. Sheldon said 15, but however they later compromised on a unknown number of kids.
                    While Penny and Bernadette are both depicted as having mean, bullying streaks, Amy may be the nicest of the trio, as she is never shown to be a bully or get angry unless she really has to, such as when she gets angry at Sheldon's uncooperative nature or when she needs to stand up for herself. When really mad she exclaims, "What the hell!"
                    Amy also remains the only one of the female trio to not become a mother by the end of the series; however, according to a brief comment made by Sheldon in the Young Sheldon Season 1 finale narration, the couple have children in the future.
                    In Young Sheldon season 3 episode Body Glitter and a Mall Safety Kit, Sheldon narrates that he offered Amy a hot beverage in the middle of the delivery, confirming they have at least one child.
                    They have a son named Leonard Cooper (originally Leonard Nimoy Cooper, which Sheldon wanted to name him), but Amy rejected it (Graduation). Amy let him name him Leonard after Leonard Hofstadter which was never confirmed.
                    According to Mayim Bialik, Amy's new hairstyle in "The Change Constant" was a wig. By the time the next episode (the series finale "The Stockholm Syndrome") was filmed, Mayim had gotten her hair styled, thus her hair in that episode was natural.
