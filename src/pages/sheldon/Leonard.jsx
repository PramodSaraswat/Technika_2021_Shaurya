                    <br />
                    Dr. Leonard Leakey Hofstadter, Ph.D., is an experimental physicist at the
                    California Institute of Technology who formerly roomed with Sheldon Cooper in Apartment 4A and now he and his
                    wife Penny live in that apartment and they also formerly lived in Penny's apartment Apartment 4B. Along with Sheldon,
                    he is one of the main male protagonists of The Big Bang Theory. Originally from New Jersey, Leonard attended Princeton
                    University[3] and was twenty-four years old when he received his doctorate with a Dissertation of the Year award for
                    experimental particle physics. Having lived with Sheldon for 1 decade as of Season 6, he and Leonard are best friends;
                    however, Leonard can become very agitated by many of his eccentricities and often feels obligated to explain Sheldon's
                    behavior and serve as a Mediation|mediator between him and other people in situations – he's been described as the straight
                    man of the series. While Leonard, along with his geek friends and fellow scientists, is somewhat socially inept,
                    Leonard would like to be better accepted outside of his social group. Leonard is better-adjusted than his companions,
                    being more willing to try different things. He appears to be best suited as a leader of the group, with Sheldon commenting
                    how Leonard is the "Kirk" of their landing party. The romance between him and neighbor Penny, with their on-and-off
                    relationship has been the major force for drama til Shamy started.
                <br />
                <br />
                                     <br />

                    <h4 id="Early_Life">    Early Life (Before the series-2007)<br /></h4>
                    Leonard was born on May 17, 1980 in New Jersey to Alfred and Beverly Hofstadter
                    (Same month that Mt. St. Helens' erupted and "The Empire Strikes Back" came out.). Not much is known about his early life.
                    He has two siblings: a younger brother named Michael and an elder sister that we don't know the name of
                    ("The Maternal Capacitance", S2E15).
                    At age five, Leonard dressed up as The Hulk, using his mother's make-up and made-up muscles (balloon muscles)
                    with a bra of his mother's to stop them from sagging. He had dressed up as The Hulk cause he was always mad at his mom and
                    he wanted to smash his way out of the house and at age six, he walked in on his mother and father naked. She was swatting his
                    father's bottom with Leonard's brand new ping-pong paddle and Leonard thought it was a dream until years later
                    ("The Raiders Minimization", S7E4). From that same age, he had been dreaming about spending Valentine's Day with a girl
                    ("The Large Hadron Collision" (S3E15)).<br /><br />
                    At age eight his mother humiliated him by making him give back a ribbon at a science fair. He said it was his first science
                    fair and that he had to give the ribbon back because he had done "Do Lima Beans React Better to Classical Music?".
                    His brother had previously done "Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock N' Roll?" ("The Pants Alternative", S3E18).
                    At age ten, he built a hugging machine to compensate for lack of affection which his father used to borrow
                    ("The Maternal Capacitance", S2E15). His father was an anthropologist who spent more time with a 2000-year-old skeleton
                    of an Etruscan boy than with Leonard, who then said "I hated that kid" when he recalled this fact in
                    "The Fish Guts Displacement", (S6E10).<br />
                    <br />
                    He did not celebrate his birthday or Christmas as a child ("The Peanut Reaction", S1E16) due to his mother having the
                    family study the holidays for their "anthropological and sociological implications on society" and only celebrating
                    achievements in the family ("The Peanut Reaction" (S1E16) & "The Maternal Congruence", S3E11).
                    The family wrote research papers for Christmas and they were returned graded with his stocking.
                    ("The Santa Simulation", S6E11) As Leonard was a geek, he was bullied badly as a youth and he stopped growing in the
                    eighth grade. Throughout his childhood, his mother constantly conducted tests on him. One Easter his mother sent him
                    out on an Easter egg hunt without putting out any eggs to see how long he would search for them (Took til June to figure
                    the scheme out) ("The Raiders Minimization", S7E4). Before he went to Princeton, his parents put him in advanced placement
                    classes and sent him to learn cello, "getting me beaten up enough", as he described himself ("The Hamburger Postulate", S1E5).
                    Johnny Galecki does play the cello. Leonard had his first kiss at age 19 to a girl named Geraldine Coco (not Cuoco).<br />                    <br />

                    <br/>
                    After graduating from high school, Leonard attended Princeton University and got his doctorate at age 24.
                    In 2003, he met Sheldon Cooper, with whom he began sharing an apartment, but not before meeting Howard Wolowitz
                    and Rajesh Koothrappali. The 4 guys became a group and hung out often. On June 30, 2004, Leonard and Howard made
                    a Girlfriend Pact. The pact was that when one of the two got a girlfriend, they would have that girlfriend set the
                    single guy up with a female friend of her own ("The Creepy Candy Coating Corollary" (S3E5)).<br />
                    Although Leonard feels at home with his geek colleagues, he is reluctant to let others know about his recreational activities (such as Klingon Boggle), as he does not like to be seen as a geek and wants to be more social. Sweet, thoughtful, kind, intelligent, mature, sardonic and socially awkward, but well-meaning, Leonard also seems to be the most well-adjusted and sensible one of The Social Group, and is quick to try new things apart from his geek friends. Just like his friends, he is also a man-child that can't grow up.
                    <br/>
                    <h4 id="Character">Characterisation </h4>
                    Despite his reasonable nature, he can sometimes display selfishness, normally putting his needs before his friends' well-being. During the group's expedition to North Pole he tricks Sheldon into thinking that he had definitively proven slow moving magnetic monopoles when in reality it was simply static from him switching the electric can opener on and off as he they wanted to kill Sheldon. When they return from the North Pole he is totally humiliated among his scientific peers. Sheldon fled to Texas to live with his mother, Leonard, despite the trick being his idea, wanted Raj and Howard to go to Texas without him to convince Sheldon to come back, just so that he could have first sex with Penny ("The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation"). Another example is when he refuses for Zack Johnson to be Superman for the comic book store's costume party because Zack has actual muscles ("The Justice League Recombination"). Another example of Leonard's selfishness was when he was sleeping with Raj's sister Priya, and didn't seem to care how Raj felt about the situation ("The Cohabitation Formulation").

                    A lifetime of being denied and rejected of praise and acclaim that he unavoidably deserves (Because his mother had absolutely no regard or admiration for him and often ruined his infrequent moments of happiness as a child, and Sheldon relentlessly unknowingly demoralizes him and his accomplishments out of egomania and sheer apathy) has led to Leonard yearning for recognition for his intelligence, compassion and determination. He becomes extremely bitter when he discovers that a major science paper that he and Sheldon cooperatively wrote was published with only Sheldon's name (which was obviously Sheldon's fault due to Sheldon being an arrogant credit hog). He also admits to Sheldon that he is an egotist who needs his big ego to be constantly validated from people who are much less smarter than he is while presenting their paper to a class of graduate students.

                    As a result of how he was raised (Unloved and under-appreciated, due to the lack of love from his parents, his mother's views of raising children as obviously opposed to his father's), he was not as intelligent as his siblings and his mother having been unloving, unsupportive and neglectful altogether and treating Leonard as a personal science experiment instead. Leonard was seen as not any happier than Sheldon (who grew up loved) and frequently insecure and sometimes unhappy. But that soon changed during his second relationship with Penny. She made him more confident during their relationship (Since Penny always gave him lots of love and affection and Leonard was only in love with her the day they first met) and by the time they were married, Leonard was much happier than he had ever been in his life, having married the love of his life, as said by Amy and Bernadette in "The Separation Oscillation" (even his mother thought that perhaps she was wrong that they shouldn't be together due to Penny's education status, but when she saw how happy Leonard had been since their marriage, which she had never seen before, she thought they were a good couple together).

                  <br/><br/>  Among the main characters, he generally has the least amount of difficulty interacting with "ordinary" individuals, as compared to Sheldon (who is unable to grasp social norms), Raj (who is unable to talk to women outside his family unless under the influence of alcohol until the end of season 6), and even Howard (who is often seen as "creepy" when flirting with women) since Leonard is the only one of them interested and quite adept in building interpersonal and social relationships with other people. Compared to his friends, he is also relatively the most successful with women.

                    Between Sheldon and him, Leonard is the only one who feels that he "should do something" when Penny begins to recount her recent breakup. Leonard usually blurts out the wrong things in front of women when he is nervous, such as when he's trying to invite Penny to lunch and mentions that curry is a natural laxative, or, as in "The Plimpton Stimulation" where he can't decide what to say he will often combine thoughts. i.e. "Hi-lo," instead of "Hi," or "Hello."

<br/><br/>

                    Despite his attempts to reject his geek status, Leonard owns, among other things, Star Wars hygiene products, an expensive Superman comic book collection, a "Battlestar Galactica" Colonial warrior's flight suit, and a light saber that he calls a "glow stick". Early in the series, Leonard tried to get rid of his collectibles to show maturity and impress Penny; however, he changed his mind when he saw Penny was already dating another man.

                    Leonard is indicated to be proficient in literature, history, and music as well as the sciences - he is able to solve a woman's crossword puzzle in a matter of seconds (the answers were mostly literary in nature) and he can play the cello.

                    Having lived with Sheldon for many years, they are best friends, and he is obligated to explain Sheldon's irrational behavior and serve as a mediator between him and other people in many situations; however, Leonard often gets very irritated by much of his behavior. For instance, when Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Leonard gave Penny the phone number of Sheldon's mother so she would call her son and scold Sheldon for his behavior, thus ending the fight, as shown in the episode "The Panty Piñata Polarization".

                    Leonard is also upset that Sheldon dislikes his favorite show, "Babylon 5", which Sheldon refuses to allow to be watched in his apartment. Like everyone, he dislikes his friend's habit of rattling off different trivial facts. Leonard's IQ of 173 is not as high as Sheldon's and the latter has scoffed at Leonard's whiteboard theories as common enough to be "scribbled on the wall of every men's room at MIT."

                    <br/><br/>    Leonard seems to get along well with Howard. Leonard and Howard even have a Girlfriend Pact, which Leonard invoked in "The Desperation Emanation" so that Howard would help him get a girlfriend. In "The Peanut Reaction", Howard tried to make Leonard's birthday a surprise, going as far as getting himself hospitalized, proving to Leonard how much Howard cares for him though Penny also proposed him the phone number of one of her slutty friends. Leonard also seems to get along well with Raj. Although Leonard does get irritated by much of Raj's impulsive and eccentric behavior, as in "The Griffin Equivalency" where Raj became pompous and self-absorbed after being chosen to be in People magazine.

                    Leonard has a lot of conditions. He is lactose intolerant, asthmatic, bespectacled due to myopia, prone to carsickness and migraines, gets a bloody nose after jogging, suffers from sleep apnea, allergies and a lot of ear infections, and possesses a genetic predisposition to heart disease. Leonard's primary health concern is his lactose intolerance. He avoids eating even small amounts of dairy products (including cheese, yogurt and butter), as well as melon and desserts at The Cheesecake Factory, for fear of his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal and resulting in the emission of a noxious gas that Sheldon maintains can be weaponized. This digestive trait is often the subject of teasing. According to the pilot episode, he cannot process corn either.

                    Leonard is self-conscious about his childhood bed-wetting, particularly given his middle name, Leakey (he was named for noted British archaeologist and naturalist Louis Leakey). He similarly despises that the word "nerd" is in his first name.

<br/><br/>


                    Leonard is somewhat neurotic, insecurely tilting his head as he speaks nervously, as well as avoiding eye contact and squinting. When under great stress, his voice is elevated to a high-pitched whine, when he lies or gets sweaty. At times, Leonard's demeanor seems very low energy and somewhat irritable. Clumsy, he often bangs his head, which induces vomiting. Leonard is incredibly sensitive about his height (he stopped growing in eighth grade), although he enjoys pointing out that Howard is shorter.

                    Leonard is usually seen wearing his characteristic black-framed glasses, neutral-colored jackets or vests over a hoodie, low-cut black Converse sneakers, brown trousers, and physics-themed t-shirts. Along with questionable fashion choices, including mismatched color schemes, he sometimes applies an absurd amount of hair gel; however, his girlfriends often buy him new clothes, and he has put aside his corduroy suit for formal occasions to don a fancy silk shirt and vest or blazer, much to Penny's approval. His formal suits style improves with time. He always wears his hoodies because Sheldon has the thermostat set so low.

                    Over the course of the series, despite retaining his geeky habits, Leonard's confidence has grown and he has become more socially adept throughout the series. Leonard is also somewhat charismatic and a good leader in certain situations, which Sheldon shockingly recognizes.

                    <h4 id="Family">Family</h4>

            <br/><br/>        All of the members of Leonard Hofstadter's family are accomplished scientists, apart from his younger brother, Michael, who is a successful law professor. Leonard is actually the least successful of his family in their respective fields.

                    His mother, Beverly, is a psychiatrist and neuroscientist who has a personality identical to Sheldon's, including strict speech patterns, lack of social conventions, and attention to details. She is mainly responsible for the difficult childhood Leonard had. Due to his mother's views, Leonard never celebrated his birthday during his childhood, and when she visited him, she didn't see the point of viewing his unoriginal research since it had already been done.

                    She never gave him any sort of approval growing up and one time humiliated him when she forced him to give back an award at the school fair because it was too similar to his brother's earlier project resulting in his recurrent bed-wetting. In "The Pants Alternative," Leonard suggested the reason that his brother is 8" taller than him is due to his mother's lack of nurturing him as a child. In "The Engagement Reaction," Penny similarly suggests that Leonard's lack of nurturing from his mother "makes him desperate to please women." Leonard had mentioned to Penny that when he was young he built a "hugging machine" with two self-constructed remote-controlled arms in order to compensate for the lack of affection from his mother; the saddest thing was that his father used to borrow it too. Beverly also mentioned to Howard that Leonard's brother (Michael) and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is, but she was not proud of them as they weren't "her" accomplishments. When he was six, Leonard had walked in on his naked parents while his mother was spanking his father's bottom with his new ping-pong paddle. Leonard had thought that that incident had been a nightmare of his youth. When Leonard told her about his engagement to Penny, she was willing to accept it because Sheldon was fond of Penny. In return, Leonard has a huge desire to harm his mother or have bad things happen to her, blames all the horrible stories and issues of his childhood on her, considers all her books to be garbage and as a result of his upbringing, Leonard is desperate to please women and has sometimes been quite insecure until Penny made him more confident, as said by Amy and Bernadette in "The Separation Oscillation". Beverly attends Sheldon's birthday party and gets hit on by Barry Kripke to Leonard's discomfort. Later, she visits and Penny tries to bond with her, resulting in a vow renewal ceremony since Beverly was disappointed about not receiving an invitation to their Las Vegas wedding. Leonard infuriates her by inviting his father. In "The Conjugal Conjecture", Leonard's father says that even though he and Beverly don't bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. In the "The Maternal Conclusion", Leonard realizes that his mother will never change and he forgives her. She says that helps and they have a truly motherly embrace.

                    <br/><br/>     Leonard's brother, Michael, is a Harvard University law professor and is engaged and later married to the youngest appellate court judge in New Jersey history. Leonard also says that his brother is eight inches taller than him. Later in Season 8, it is revealed that he had recently argued a case before the Supreme Court. He never appeared in the program.

                    Leonard's sister, whose name is unknown is a cutting-edge medical researcher working with adolescent gibbons to cure diabetes. She has even gone as far as successfully growing a human pancreas in one. Leonard also says that she is 38 years old and married in Season 4. She never appeared in the program.




                    <br/><br/>        Leonard's father, Alfred, is briefly mentioned as an anthropologist. Sheldon pointed out that Leonard's middle name, "Leakey", comes from famed archaeologist Louis Leakey with whom Leonard's father had worked, which Leonard finds humiliating. It is implied due to Beverly's nature that Leonard prefers his father over her. In Season 3, his father had an affair, which resulted in their divorce. Although his relationship with his father is unknown, it can be presumed that Leonard prefers his father more. In "The Convergence-Convergence" Alfred appears and he and Leonard appear to get on really well, is happy for the couple and is very fond of Penny. After sniping with his ex-wife, he and Sheldon's mother really get cozy and disappear into their hotel together, an idea that Leonard and Sheldon do not like, although it's revealed in the next episode "The Conjugal Conjecture" that they didn't sleep together, but plan on still seeing each other in the future.




                    Leonard's now-deceased Uncle Floyd was briefly mentioned in "The Maternal Capacitance" as the only person from his childhood of whom he had fond memories. In "The Codpiece Topology," though, he mentions his Aunt Edna, a very hairy woman, is sweet and would tickle him when they hugged. The closest thing he ever had to a birthday party was when his grandfather died on his birthday, so he got to see his cousins and have his favorite German chocolate cake.

                    There is male pattern baldness in his family. According to Sheldon, when his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. At Thanksgiving, his grandmother with Alzheimer's had an episode where she took her clothes off in the apartment; Leonard describing the worst part as when she carved the turkey. This took place before the series started.

                    In "The Itchy Brain Simulation," Leonard showed Penny a sweater that an aunt had made for him when he went off to college. It is bright red, very itchy and had "Lenny" spelled out on the front. At the same time as the sweater, his brother got a car from her.

                    <br/><br/>   In "The Celebration Experimentation", Beverly mentions that Sheldon was at her 60th birthday get together along with Leonard's siblings and he knew nothing about it. Penny counters that since their wedding was in Vegas, she did not get an invitation. Beverly is thankful for that. She backtracks on the wedding invitation a the end of the season.

                    In "The Explosion Implosion", after Penny answered a phone call from Beverly for Leonard, the pair developed a close bond with Beverly dishing on her recent amorous activities. Amy was jealous of Penny's close relationship with Leonard's mother, while Leonard was more annoyed that his mother told Penny she was proud of her - something Beverly has never said about him. When Leonard confronted his mother, Beverly told him how great Penny was, that out of all of her children's spouses, Penny was the best one and admitted she was proud of Leonard - if only for marrying well. Beverly also noticed that Leonard was trying hard not to cry, so she let him hang up quickly since Leonard was already being driven to tears.

                    In "The Maternal Conclusion", Beverly visits Leonard and Penny asking nice and truly interested in Leonard's new physics project. Later she admits that she is doing research for a new book which makes Leonard blowup. Finally he forgives her which makes both of them feel much better and they end in a true loving embrace.
