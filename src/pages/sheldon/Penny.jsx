                    <h2> BIOGRAPHY </h2>
                    Penny Hofstadter is a fictional character on the American CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory, portrayed by actress Kaley Cuoco. She is the primary female character in the series. She lives in Apartment 4A with her husband Leonard Hofstadter across the hall from Sheldon Cooper and Amy Farrah Fowler who live in apartment 4B where Penny used to live. Her full first name is possibly "Penelope" as implied by "The Barbarian Sublimation", as her username was "Queen Penelope," and her maiden name has never been revealed, but due to her marriage to Leonard, her last name is Hofstadter. She was unknowingly married to her ex-boyfriend Zack Johnson for three years, so her name could include "Johnson." That marriage was finally annulled in "The Thanksgiving Decoupling".

             <br/> <br/>      An aspiring, but mostly unsuccessful actress, she was born on a farm near Omaha, Nebraska, and worked at The Cheesecake Factory as a waitress until she quit in "The Occupation Recalibration" (S7E13) to take up acting full-time. Penny was the original female lead in the show before being joined by Bernadette Rostenkowski and Amy Farrah Fowler and in season 8 started working at the same company as did Bernadette. She had her five minutes of fame in "Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill".

              <br/><br/>      She has always been Leonard's love interest since the Pilot, with the two dating briefly in the over the first season/second season break, for most of the third season, and they rekindled their romance in "The Recombination Hypothesis". As of "The Gorilla Dissolution", she and Leonard became engaged and were married at the start of season 9 in "The Matrimonial Momentum", followed by a vow renewal at the start of season 10 in "The Conjugal Conjecture". As of the series finale "The Stockholm Syndrome", they are currently expecting their first child (2019).

                    <br/><br/>        Even though she is considered part of the guys' group, she represents the "dumb blonde" for viewer context in the series with a lot of street smarts and communication skills to compensate for her lack of academic knowledge and common sense. As the series progresses, her knowledge of geeky subjects such as Doctor Who even surprises her.
                <br />
                <br />
                    <h4>     Early Life <br/></h4>
                    Penny was born on December 2, 1985 in Nebraska, a small a town outside of Omaha to Wyatt and Susan. She also has one sister named Lisa and one brother named Randall. During her childhood, Penny had issues with her father who wanted a boy and he treated Penny like one (until she developed breasts), like making her play catch, calling her 'Slugger' etc. When Penny was 12, she rebuilt a tractor engine all by herself ("The Big Bran Hypothesis"), started dating at the age of 14 ("The Robotic Manipulation"), nearly became pregnant ("The Staircase Implementation") and had an active sex life that she defines as being popular. She also stole a horse one time while drunk in high school. Her boyfriends used to crawl in and out of her window. Most were very dumb according to her father.
               <h4>Characterisation</h4>
                    When she first met the guys in the Pilot, Penny was writing a screenplay about a girl from Lincoln, Nebraska who travels to Los Angeles at the age of 18 to become an actress, but ends up working at The Cheesecake Factory instead. When Leonard asks if the screenplay was autobiographical, she replies that it isn't, because she is from a small town outside of Omaha, Nebraska.

               <br/><br/>     Penny moved into the apartment building because she split with Kurt, her boyfriend for 4 years. She says she still loved him, and insinuates he cheated on her. The shower in her apartment was broken at the time, so the boys offered her theirs. Her apartment is sloppy and disorganized, but Penny appears to like it that way.



                    <br/><br/>    She is either oblivious to or completely aware of her effect on the boys, because within minutes of meeting him, she asked Leonard to retrieve her television set from Kurt's apartment, which he immediately set out to do. Penny is aware of Leonard's crush on her, and it is hinted throughout the series that some of the feelings are reciprocated. At the end of season one, Penny goes on a date with Leonard. Leonard is nervous, and Penny slightly withdrawn, but they share a kiss.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In season two, there was some initial enthusiasm between Penny and Leonard; however, they later develop insecurities concerning their relationship. Penny was worried that she was not smart enough for Leonard, and lied about graduating from community college because she thought it would make Leonard respect her. The relationship quickly deteriorated and she goes back to dating different guys. Leonard showed Penny some literature on Pasadena City College and she interpreted it as him wanting a woman with more education and they break up.


                    <br/><br/>   She gives relationship advice to Sheldon and Leonard fairly often: Leonard, when he has problems with Priya or Stephanie, and Sheldon when he's with Amy. She also starts to become geekier through the guys. She makes inadvertent references to Star Trek, and, thanks to Sheldon, becomes addicted to Age of Conan. She also dates Stuart, who runs the comic book store. However, when Penny and Stuart are making out, she accidentally calls him Leonard, and as a result, they stop seeing each other.



                    <br/><br/>  When she learns that the guys are going on an Arctic expedition, she is visibly upset, buys Leonard a farewell gift, and tells herself, after speaking with him, that she wishes he wasn't going.




                    <br/><br/>  In season three, when the boys get back from the expedition, Penny kisses Leonard the second she sees him; however, Leonard and Penny's relationship has a rocky start because they have some trouble getting used to being more than friends, but they eventually start a relatively stable relationship.

                    <h4>Family</h4>

                    Penny's Sister Lisa is mentioned as having shot her husband while they were both intoxicated. Her name wasn't revealed until the last season.

                    <br/><br/>    It is known that she has a nephew who turned 13 in season two, likely the son of Lisa.

                    <br/><br/>    When Christy (Penny's friend from Omaha) comes into town, Penny reveals that she has a brother and at least one male cousin, as she claims that Christy slept with the former while being engaged to the latter.

                    Her brother, Randall, works in a meth lab. This fact is first hinted at in "The Pirate Solution" as Penny describes him as "kind of a chemist" and tells Leonard that he would like him. It is finally confirmed in "The Rhinitis Revelation" when she asks God to make her brother stop cooking meth, but without involving the authorities. In season 7 in "The Hesitation Ramification", Penny mentions that her Dad gathered all the relatives together to see her scene on NCIS, which included getting her brother a day out of rehab. They also bought a large sandwich to share. When her scene is cut, Penny mentions that the sandwich and her brother are gone and as far as she knows her brother is on the way to Mexico. She also mentioned wanting to postpone her wedding with Leonard until he gets paroled. Randall appeared on the series in "The Conjugal Conjecture" for his sister's vow renewal.

                    <br/><br/>   Sheldon implies Penny's mother, Susan, is overweight and in "The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition" says that her mother must have used cannabis when she was expectant with her. In "The Status Quo Combustion", Penny is discussing her engagement with her mother, tells her that she is NOT pregnant and that that is unusual in their family. She had lost the weight by Leonard and Penny's second wedding and vow renewal.

                    <br/><br/>  In season two, "The Maternal Capacitance", as Penny is explaining to Beverly that her father stopped playing catch with her when she developed breasts, she quotes her mother talking to her father, and suggests his name is "Bob", though it is later revealed in "The Boyfriend Complexity" to be Wyatt. Her father visits Penny and begs Leonard to get back with her because he wants grandchildren who don't live in a house on wheels. Her parents like Leonard because he is smarter than the dumb boys that Penny usually dated.

                    In "The Conjugal Conjecture", Penny is happy to have her family visiting. She has a close relationship with her father and a little tenser one with her mother. She takes her brother with a smile and a joke. Later, she thinks about offering her brother Sheldon's old room after her father asks her to get him a job interview at her company.

                    <br/><br/>   When Penny says that she doesn't want any kids, her father probably learned this from Leonard and complains to Penny about not getting any more grandchildren. In "The Donation Oscillation", Wyatt visits LA and finds it strange that Leonard is donating sperm to Zack and that Penny doesn't want any kids. He is disappointed and Penny admits that she thinks that she is letting everyone down too. Wyatt tells her how great it is raising kids, but will support her choice.

               <h4>Trivia</h4>
                    <br/><br/>      Penny was 21 years old at the beginning of the show, which means she is the youngest of the gang. Penny is a Sagittarius, meaning she was born between November 22 and December 21.<br/><br/> In "The Prestidigitation Approximation", Howard does a fake magic card trick in which the sum of the digits of one's birth date, excluding the year, are used to get the number of the card to be selected.<br/><br/> Penny turns over the fifth card, making her birthday in the span of the Sagittarius one of four possibilities: November 30, December 2, December 11, or December 20. <br/><br/>If Penny's birthday is November 30th (1+1+3+0=5), it would match the birthday of Kaley Cuoco (Saturday, November 30, 1985) exactly. The only possible birth date of Penny would be Monday, December 2, 1985 if one alternatively interprets the rules of Howard's card trick as requiring one to turn over the card corresponding to the sum of the digits of the month and adding the day. In "The Platonic Permutation" Leonard confirms that Penny's birthday is December 2. Though David Underhill refers to Penny as a "gorgeous 22-year-old" in "The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis" (air-date December 15, 2008), he could have simply estimated her age, as it certainly appears to be close to Christmas and the episodic events probably span days rather than weeks (if one were to ignore the hypothesis that the air date is reality in the show). In real life, Cuoco is the youngest of the group, and approximately 13 years younger than Jim Parsons, who is the oldest of the group.
                    <br/><br/>Penny has been seen naked by three of the boys, Leonard, Sheldon and Raj in the series. Howard is the only person who never sees her naked.
                    <br/><br/>Leonard had coitus with her multiple times in season 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. (Only one time in season 5). Leonard eventually became the only one to see Penny naked due to marrying her.
                    <br/><br/>Sheldon peeked at her while trying to help her get dressed due to her injured shoulder in "The Adhesive Duck Deficiency".
                    <br/><br/>Raj and Penny got undressed and had a one-night stand in "The Roommate Transmogrification" (though it was revealed in the episode after that they never had intercourse at all).
                    <br/><br/>In "The Robotic Manipulation", Sheldon calculates that Penny dated an estimate of 193 (±8) men and had relations with approximately 31 of them.
                    <br/><br/>      Penny grew up on a farm and rebuilt an entire tractor engine all by herself at the age of twelve.
                    <br/><br/>Penny was a junior rodeo champion.
                    <br/><br/>The previous occupant of Penny's apartment was a 200-pound transvestite named Louie/Louise with a skin condition, who worked as a police officer, according to Sheldon. He is seen during a flashback in "The Staircase Implementation", where he refers to Sheldon as 'crazy'.
                    <br/><br/>  Penny is the only member of the main set of characters whose last nor middle name was never spoken or revealed, even though Bill Prady claimed it eventually would be.
                    <br/><br/>    In "Pilot," Penny claims to be a vegetarian, but will eat fish and the occasional steak.
                    <br/><br/>Penny often smells like either vanilla (because she wears the oil) or cheesecake (because she works at The Cheesecake Factory). Sheldon has also stated in "The Decoupling Fluctuation" that she uses green, apple-scented shampoo, insisting that she switch back to that from coconut.
                    <br/><br/>  Penny's acquaintance Christy could be a reference to Kaley Cuoco's time on Charmed. Penny was also the name of the witches' grandmother. The reference may also apply to Penny's father's name, Wyatt.
                    <br/><br/>  Her beliefs in psychics, ghosts, astrology, voodoo, and other 'superstitions' (but not healing crystals) may be also be a reference to Kaley Cuoco's time on Charmed.
                    <br/><br/>Penny is very similar to Paige Michalchuk from Degrassi.
                    <br/><br/>   Both were the most popular girls in high school, they're Caucasian blondes, their personalities are similar, and they have a tendency to refer to people by a given nickname (Penny calls people "sweetie" while Paige calls people "hon").
                    <br/><br/>Furthermore, Penny occasionally shows hints of bisexuality, while Paige is confirmed to be bisexual.
                    <br/><br/>Penny eats Chinese food with a fork and double-dips her egg rolls (unappealing attributes, according to Sheldon).
                    <br/><br/> In "The Staircase Implementation", it is revealed that Penny was almost a teenage mother.
                    <br/><br/>   Penny is often kindhearted and shows empathy toward others, but can become quite fierce when provoked.
                    <br/><br/> Penny is very protective and supportive of Leonard and encourages him to stand up for himself.
                    <br/><br/>    When under pain medication, Penny exhibits some of Sheldon's behaviors.
                    <br/><br/> Penny has an amazing sense of smell.
                    <br/><br/>Penny believes in psychics, ghosts, astrology, voodoo and other 'superstitions', but not healing crystals.
                    <br/><br/>  Penny went to community college but dropped out for unspecified reasons. She goes back near the beginning of the sixth season, taking one history course. By the middle of the season, she is also taking an acting class and at the beginning of season 7, she is taking a psychology class as well.
                    <br/><br/>  Every member of the gang (except Stuart) have seen Penny with black eye(s).
                    <br/><br/>    All of the guys first saw her with a black eye in "The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition" (S02E19)
                    <br/><br/>       Amy and Bernadette first saw Penny with two black eyes in "The Parking Spot Escalation" (S06E09).
                    <br/><br/>     A running gag of the show involves Sheldon knocking on Penny's door and saying her name after every three knocks. He repeats this statement thrice or until she answers the door.
                    <br/><br/> This stemmed from Sheldon catching his father having an affair as revealed in "The Hot Tub Contamination".
                    <br/><br/>Penny often resorts to freeloading. When Sheldon's mom pointed out her disapproval of a top (shirt) belonging to Penny, she said that she had received free drinks by wearing that top. It is also known that, while she was dating Leonard, she never paid for her movie tickets. She also gets free meals from hanging with the guys since her portions were always paid by Leonard; she said they were loans, but she knew Leonard would not ask her to pay it back. She also gets free internet by using Sheldon and Leonard's wi-fi—leading Sheldon to regularly change the password to ones which accuse her of freeloading.
                    <br/><br/>She turned down Sheldon's offer for a date (although Sheldon only asked her to make Amy jealous) as Penny was the only other woman that Sheldon knew well.
                    <br/><br/>  Penny was a bully in high school, making fun of a girl with a stutter and taping another girl up and leaving her out in a corn field until the next morning; she (along with the entire Zangen staff) would later become subjected to Bernadette's bullying ways. Being friends with Bernadette and Amy was her redemption for her mean girl ways. Even marrying Leonard was also part of her redemption. She even apologized to the girl she bullied in high school. It's never confirmed if the girl (now woman) accepted it on the phone.
                    <br/><br/> Penny is remarkably adept at games in general, excelling at Halo, Age of Conan, and chess, checkmating Leonard on her first try (though the latter may have been because, as Sheldon has pointed out, Leonard is terrible at chess).
                    <br/><br/>   Penny owns a red 1980s Volkswagen Cabriolet Mk1 convertible car. Featured in several episodes, the car appears to be in a bad condition, which is not helped by Penny, who pays no heed to the warning lights of the car. While sitting in her car, Sheldon will continuously remind her that the 'check engine' warning light is on, an action that irritates Penny tremendously. Penny starts as a very bad driver: in "The Guitarist Amplification", a point of argument between Penny and Leonard is when Penny finds out that Leonard complains about her driving behind her back. Later in the episode, she runs a stop sign without even noticing it, and then, when Leonard mentions it, she looks back to find it and Leonard, panicking, shouts "EYES ON THE ROAD, EYES ON THE ROAD!" She had gotten a car from Leonard in "The Friendship Turbulence" when her car broke down and she could not afford to fix it.
                    <br/><br/>When Penny is shocked, she bats her eyelashes several times while considering a reaction.
                    <br/><br/> Over the course of the series, Penny has exhibited traits of alcoholism. She is often seen drinking wine or other harder beverages while in her apartment, both alone and in the presence of her friends. She often seems to use wine as a means to deal with her issues. She will many times use this method on her friends as well to help them deal with their problems, most notably when she realized alcoholic drinks are able to help Raj overcome his selective mutism, or to help Sheldon overcome his stage fright.
                    <br/><br/> She often says "OMG" or "Oh My God" when shocked, to the annoyance of Sheldon.
                    <br/><br/> Despite Amy's admiration for Penny, she does realize her limitations in her intelligence and her acting career.
                    <br/><br/> In "The Scavenger Vortex", no one wanted Penny on their team because she was a "liability".
                    <br/><br/>    Penny thinks that the wedding chapels in Las Vegas perform fake weddings.
                    <br/><br/> Penny was unknowingly married to Zack Johnson, as a result of her not believing in Las Vegas weddings being real as mentioned above.
                    <br/><br/>   In "The Adhesive Duck Deficiency", when Sheldon was dressing her, due to her dislocated shoulder, he had to put her hurt arm into the sleeve. He grabbed what he thought was her arm, but was actually her breast.
                    <br/><br/>It was discovered by Sheldon that Penny has a Chinese character tattooed on her right butt cheek. She believes it to signify "courage", but Sheldon reads it as "soup".
                    <br/><br/>  Though Wyatt (Penny's father) has been featured in the show, "The Maternal Capacitance" references the name of Penny's father to be called "Bob".
                    <br/><br/>   So far Penny has been the only person in The Social Group to witness a Shamy kiss onscreen until Shamy's wedding.
                    <br/><br/>   In the count of the number of proposals to each other, Penny has three, Leonard has three through the time they got engaged.
                    <br/><br/> She is called "Blondie" by Leslie Winkle.
                    <br/><br/>It was rumored that Lisa Kudrow would be cast as Penny's mother, but this was disproved when CBS announced in July 2016 that Katey Sagal was cast as her mother, Susan and appeared in the Season 10 premiere. Cuoco Is a real life fan of Kudrow.
                    <br/><br/>Penny makes what she thinks is a smart decision and tells Leonard that they could get married. Penny also proposes for them to elope to Vegas when they can't get around to setting a wedding date.
                    <br/><br/> By the end of the eighth season, Howard is the only guy who hasn't seen Penny naked, though he saw her topless when viewing her movie "Serial Ape-ist".
                    <br/><br/>Leonard had prepared vows for their wedding ceremony; however, Penny winged it with "You've Got a Friend in Me".
                    <br/><br/>Penny owned a pet pig called Moondance which lived happily on the farm in Nebraska until Wyatt drove a tractor and rotivator over it.
                    <br/><br/>Penny was one of the gang that married Howard and Bernadette, while Bernadette married Leonard and Penny at their wedding redo ceremony.
                    <br/><br/>Bernadette, Raj, Leonard, Penny and Amy are the only characters of the social group/main cast whose parents have both been seen on-camera - Sheldon's father died when Sheldon was a child, Howard's father abandoned him and his mother when Howard was eleven, Stuart's mother and father have been mentioned and are both alive, Emily's father has been mentioned and it is not known if he is dead or alive and there has been no appearance or mention of Emily's mother or Leslie's mother and father to date.
                    <br/><br/>  According to a July 2016 article posted on the TBBT Facebook page, we would meet Penny's mother and brother in the Season 10 premiere. Her mother, Susan, was played by actress Katey Sagal (who played Kaley Cuoco's mother on 8 Simple Rules), while her brother, Randall, is played by actor Jack McBrayer (30 Rock). According to the article, Susan is "stressed out and neurotic from a life dealing with her troubled—yet cheerful—son," who, as has been mentioned numerous times, is a drug dealer and ex-con.
                    <br/><br/>  There has been no mention or showing of Penny's college education since "The Relationship Diremption". It's also unclear if she ever finished at all after re-enrolling in Season 6.
                    <br/><br/> In "The Platonic Permutation", Leonard read Penny's journal and revealed everything in it that he learned about her:
                    <br/><br/> Penny's birthday is December 2.
                    <br/><br/>   When Penny was growing up she had a dog named Pepper.
                    <br/><br/>       The street that Penny's family house and farm was on was Perkins Street.
                    <br/><br/> The last four digits of Penny's Social Security Number are 7, 6, 2, 1.
                    <br/><br/> Penny's favorite Spice Girl was Baby Spice.
                    <br/><br/>  Penny's favorite *NSYNC band member was Justin.
                    <br/><br/>Penny did not have a favorite member of the Backstreet Boys because she loved *NSYNC.
                    <br/><br/>Sheldon is afraid to wake her before 11 a.m. because Penny has an "I'll punch you in the throat" rule if he does this.
                    <br/><br/>Penny is right-handed.
                    <br/><br/>Penny is a vegetarian, except for fish and the occasional steak, and she loves steak.
                    <br/><br/>  Penny loves the series "Sex and the City".
                    <br/><br/>    Penny is the only main character yet to have her middle or maiden name (at least before she married Leonard) revealed.
                    <br/><br/> Penny is the only one of the original five main characters of the show to be absent in an episode; two in fact due to a real broken leg.
                    <br/><br/> She has a tattoo of Cookie Monster.
                    <br/><br/>In "The Procreation Calculation", Penny decided not to have kids and Leonard is upset at first, but respect her wishes. They both decide to be the cool uncle and aunt to Howard and Bernadette kids, Sheldon and Amy's kids, Penny's nephew and Leonard's nephews and nieces.
                    <br/><br/>By the series finale, Penny ends up pregnant with Leonard's child.
                    <br/><br/>           While it has been sometimes said that Leonard and Penny have nothing in common, this isn't true. There actually are several things they have in common which have rarely or never been mentioned.
                    <br/><br/>They each have one brother and one sister.
                    <br/><br/> They are the second born child of their respective parents.
                    <br/><br/>  They had issues with the opposite-gender parent while growing up.
                    <br/><br/> They are the love of each other's life
                    <br/><br/> Their careers are in some ways similar. While Leonard is a smart, brilliant and successful scientist and physicist and well-educated and accomplished academic, his work in experimental physics somehow appears to mirror Penny's average education status and her pharmaceutical sales career in which she has often had to flirt with doctors to make sales. This makes it similar due to Leonard's work being sometimes derivative and his friends having more accomplishments, as well as him being the least successful of his family.
                    <br/><br/>       Leonard and Penny love each other and even though they say they have nothing in common, both do get into the interests of the other whether it is their careers or their hobbies.
             <br/><br/>       The name Penny Teller is a reference to magician duo Penn Jillette and Raymond Teller
