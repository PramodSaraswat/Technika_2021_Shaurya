              </h2>                   Dr. Rajesh Ramayan "Raj" Koothrappali, Ph.D., is an astrophysicist and Howard Wolowitz's best friend.
                    He often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, though he has his own apartment (the Raj Mahal) in Pasadena.
                    Originally from New Delhi, Raj has an Indian English accent and, ironically, dislikes Indian food and culture.
                    He frequently portrays himself as having come from humble origins and growing up in poverty in India,
                    only for his friends to remind him that his father is a gynecologist, drives a Bentley, and has a house full of servants.
                    For the first six seasons, his principal characteristic was a case of selective mutism social anxiety disorder,
                    which did not allow him to talk to women outside of his family. This condition could be suppressed through alcohol
                    if he thought he was drinking alcohol) or experimental social anxiety medications; however, the former usually ended up changing his
                    personality, making him more obnoxious and overbearing (and at times, bitter and jerkish), while the latter tended to have unpredictable
                    side-effects.
                <br />
                <br />

                    <h4 id="Early_Life">     Early Life<br /></h4>
                    Rajesh Koothrappali was born on October 6, 1981 in New Delhi, India to Dr. V.M. Koothrappali and Mrs. Koothrappali.
                    At the age of 5 he discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon. He also has a younger sister Priya,
                    a brother named Adoot and 2 brothers and 1 other sister. While growing up in India, he didn't really like it there and grew
                    to dislike his country's food and culture.
<br /><br />
                    Later, Raj left India and attended Cambridge University, England in the United Kingdom.
                    While speaking to his then-girlfriend Lucy, he stated that he thought Cambridge University looked like Hogwarts.
                    After graduating with a degree in Astrophysics, he moved to Pasadena, California. There, he met Howard Wolowitz who
                    became his best friend and Howard's mother made Raj feel welcome into their house, (though she thought he was the gardener
                    for two years.).<br />

                    <h4 id="Character">Characterisation</h4>

                    Originally from India, Raj is slightly clueless about American culture and idioms, and dislikes Indian food and his home country. Sheldon even disputes his knowledge of Indian customs and Hinduism, and reveals Raj's native language is English (which Raj speaks with a mainly-Indian accent with a hint of British), while he seems to speak fluent Hindi. Raj stated that the reason he puts up with Sheldon is so that he could be reborn as a "well-hung billionaire with wings", according to his Hindu belief of being rewarded after reincarnation for suffering willingly; to Rajesh Koothrappali, karma is "practically Newtonian". He hates Indian music; however, he does appreciate the Indian lullabies his mother sang to him, and the catchiness of Hindi phrases, two mentioned phrases being "जो जी करे कर" - "whatever floats your boat;" and "Fever 104, बहुत अच्छे संगीत का मौजूदा घर. The phrase means: Fever 104, home of the really good current music."

                    <br /><br />     On the rare occasions when he actually gets homesick, he picks up the latest issue of "Bombay Badonkadonks" and performs Bollywood dancing. He is hypocritically sensitive to others' racist jokes about India, though he is not above making derogatory remarks about India, or, in his view, "Gandhi-ville". Raj also claims he can hold out from noxious gases because he grew up in India. Raj likes to say that he comes from the "exotic" subcontinent of India and had to overcome poverty and prejudice, to make himself appear interesting and mystical, especially when he is womanizing. More often than not, he likes to be associated with "Slumdog Millionaire", except when Howard's mother says it. Much like how Howard rarely follows kosher, Rajesh eats beef and believes that some of the Hindu Code of Manu is crazy.

                    <br />      <br />   Raj also has an extremely ambiguous attitude and opinion of his own country and upbringing, which primarily depends on the situation he finds himself in and how it would benefit him. He believes that his most flattering quality for women is not an aspect of his own character, but the fact that he has vastly rich parents. As stated before, he enjoys portraying himself as a child of poverty who heroically journeyed to America to reach for the stars, but what puts him at the opposite end of this spectrum is his rich parentage. He portrayed himself as such because it makes him appear heroic. Rajesh also tends to heavily rely on his family's wealth for his own lifestyle, often wielding the family fortunes extravagantly. He enjoys his privileged lifestyle to such an extent that, when he wanted something off his father he offered to cut off the cleaning lady so that he could provide for himself, then muttering to Cinnamon that they were both going to be living like animals. Much like Howard would only consider that either his mother or Bernadette would do housework, or any work around his living space, Raj essentially never pays to survive - his parents pay his insurances and rent and he pays someone to buy food and even walk his dog. This leads to the speculation that, even though Raj is an adult, he acts like a spoiled child.

                    <br /><br />     In addition, Raj could be extremely pompous when it suited him: he referred to Priya as his baby sister, and when he discovered Leonard was having an affair with her, he verbally forbade it and voiced that he apparently had authority over their relationship. In this same incident, he used Sheldon's claim that Indian women's relationship could be controlled by the older male relative (Meaning that, in order to adhere to this rule that he would have to be loyal to Indian custom), only to arrogantly brush aside Priya's pointing out that he was currently eating meat not permitted in his culture (He claimed, when faced with this, that he could avoid certain regulations of his culture if he considered it crazy). His protectiveness of his sister, or his view of her in general, is laughable in some respects - when he tells Howard to stay away from Priya and stated that she was way hotter than Howard's girlfriend, the exact second after Howard agreed with him Raj snapped, "Dude, that's my sister you're talking about!'; later on, when he learns of Howard's pact with Leonard that prohibits them from interest in Priya, Raj is sated when Howard says that they 'pinky-swore' on the pact, but later on he explosively stated that defiling Priya superseded a pinky-swear.

                    <br /><br />        He used to have a psychological condition called selective mutism, a recognized social anxiety disorder which rendered him unable to talk to women (with the exception of family members, who were seemingly unaware of his condition, and deaf women, as seen in "The Wiggly Finger Catalyst" when he could talk in front of Emily), although he quickly learned that he was able to temporarily overcome this problem by consuming either alcohol-containing foods and medicine or experimental anti-anxiety medication. Unfortunately, the alcohol altered his personality and the medications tended to have side effects, such as involuntary face and hand motions, loss of rationality, or jovially stripping naked in public without cognizance of its inappropriate nature. Raj was also able to speak in the presence of women if they were part of a crowd, if he was unaware of their presence, or if he believed that he has been drinking alcohol (a placebo effect, as seen in "The Terminator Decoupling" when he was able to talk to Summer Glau while drinking beer, but when Howard pointed out that the beer was non-alcoholic, he could no longer speak to her). Raj noted, however, that this obstacle was an improvement over his previous affliction, in which the presence of women would cause him to lose bladder control, a condition mostly remedied by the meditation methods of ancient Indian gurus. (He does still have a "nervous bladder" in the sense that he gets an urge to relieve himself when under stress.) When Lucy broke up with him In the season six finale, "The Bon Voyage Reaction," he discovered while talking to Penny that he was... well, talking to Penny, even though he had not consumed any alcohol since the previous night, which made him realize that breaking things off with Lucy seemed to allowed him to finally overcome his selective mutism. As of season 7, he no longer requires alcohol in order to speak in front of females though it did temporarily return when he first tried to have sex with his arranged bride Anu.

                    <br /><br />     One of Raj's primary personality quirks beside his selective mutism is his tendency to speak or act inappropriately in most situations. One primary example of the latter was when, in "The Love Car Displacement", he enters Leonard and Penny's room while they are about to have sex, climbs into bed and goes to sleep, completely unaware of what he interrupted. On another occasion, he openly acknowledged having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, simultaneously making them uncomfortable and making Amy upset, and fails to recognize Amy's change in mood despite Penny and Bernadette's discreet efforts to indicate it to him. Seen in "The Santa Simulation". Raj and his friends also have made suggestions like driving around with a van to pick up children for their proposed comic book shop and enticing them with candy, unknowingly suggesting pedophilia.

                    <br /><br />     He complains that he is lonely, which leads to Raj hating himself and needing to be reassured of his value. While usually sweet, Rajesh Koothrappali sometimes smiles at his friends' misfortunes, especially if he stands to selfishly benefit from said misfortunes (such as, for example, when he expects Bernadette, whom he had a crush on at the time, to break up with Howard, figuring that he could then take advantage and move in on her). Whenever Raj gets an idea or wants to say something slightly controversial in a conversation, he whispers it in Howard or someone else's ear whenever a woman is around. Howard does refuse to say it out loud because he finds it stupid, offensive, or inappropriate, but he ends up saying it anyway through scoffing at Raj. He also has arguments with Howard often, being akin to those of a married couple. He is noted for using "gangsta" slang, such as "fo' shizzle" and repeatedly using the word "dude".


                    <br /><br />

                    He enjoys reading DC Comics, as do his friends, but he dislikes Aquaman. Raj often obsesses over almost-insignificant details in fiction, such as how toilets work in Atlantis, the possible symbolism of ponytails in Avatar, whether Wolverine's prostate is made of adamantium, what zombies would eat if humanity was exterminated, how vampires would shave themselves since they can't see their reflections, etc. He has experienced gaming addiction and, like Sheldon and Howard, he idolizes Stephen Hawking. Unlike the other guys, Raj has shown great interest in some non-geeky things likes John Grisham novels and Archie comics, the latter being shared with Zack. Raj also has an interest in a number of books, movies and TV shows which are generally targeted towards the female demographic, such as Twilight, The Good Wife, Grey's Anatomy, Sex and the City, Eat, Pray, Love and Bridget Jones's Diary. He follows his parents wishes and relays on them for money as seen in the episode with his drone. He parents heavily follow their religion which Raj also follows however breaks it whenever he is drunk. Eventually he stopped taking his parent's money and moved into an apartment over his friend Bert's garage.

                    <br /><br />

                    <h4 id="Family">Family</h4>
                    Raj always communicates with his parents, Dr. V.M. and Mrs. Koothrappali back in India over Skype, via webcam. They constantly try to arrange dates for him. Raj's parents want their son to marry a woman of Indian descent and give them grandchildren. Mrs. Koothrappali is especially worried that despite Raj being old enough to marry, the closest they have to a daughter-in-law is "that Jewish boy," Howard. When they become meddling or judgmental, he often "brings his parents" into Leonard and Sheldon's apartment via his MacBook Pro, to seek his friends' support in the discussion. Like his "baby sister" Priya, whom he is very protective of, Raj calls his parents "mummy" and "daddy".

                    Despite Raj's claims that he grew up in poverty, his friends like to remind him that he comes from a very wealthy




                    <br /><br />        background. His father is a gynecologist, drives a Bentley (he also owns a Mercedes, which was later burnt by his mother), and has a house full of servants, two of them children. Raj later admits this fact, saying they are very wealthy. His parents say the same thing, believing they have nothing to complain about as they are very rich in a very poor country. In "The Wiggly Finger Catalyst", it is revealed that his parents are actually billionaires, as Sheldon claims that Raj's family's estimated wealth is 'halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck', a reference to Forbes: The Fictional 15.[This quote is seen in "The Wiggly Finger Catalyst"].

                    <br /><br />  Not much of Raj's family is known so far. Raj stated he has three brothers and two sisters in "The Hot Troll Deviation" (S4E04). One older brother is mentioned in "The Cornhusker Vortex" (S3E06) who, according to Raj, gave him his 'Patang' (fighter kite). And one of his two sisters is Priya.

                    <br /><br />   Raj's cousin Sanjay Koothrappali (aka "Dave") works in a Call Center run by AT&T. In "The Guitarist Amplification", Raj tried to avoid going to his wedding, but eventually accepted his parents' offer.

                    Another cousin, Venkatesh Koothrappali (who appeared in "The Precious Fragmentation"), works as a lawyer in Mumbai. He has poor negotiation skills, even admitting that he is useless when Raj was trying to negotiate for a jet ski.

                    <br /><br />   In "The Griffin Equivalency", Rajesh points out that his limo is bigger than the house that his grandfather grew up in and has more food too, suggesting that his family was not always wealthy. In "The Table Polarization" (S7E16), he reveals the name of his grandfather to be Dilip.

                    <br /><br /> In "The Alien Parasite Hypothesis", Raj mentions that Type 2 diabetes runs in his family, but he has no symptoms so far.

                    In "The Septum Deviation", Raj is worried about what to get his parents for their fortieth wedding anniversary. Later he gets a call from his father that he has moved out and that his parents are getting divorce lawyers. It seems over the years they did not communicate and let a lot of little things boil over until they hated each other. His mother may have also been seeing someone else.

                    <br /><br /> In "The Clean Room Infiltration", Raj's father is in the middle of a divorce and visits his son at Christmas time. Raj leaves to help his friends deal with a stray pigeon and his father is left with Amy and Penny and her boring Victorian parlor games.

                    In "The Graduation Transmission", Raj's father threatens to cut him off after he spends too much of their money on a drone (which was meant to be used to pay Raj's monthly rent). After flattering both parents, Raj ends up with a huge increase in allowance from both his divorced parents.

                    <br /><br />In "The Allowance Evaporation", Raj after meeting his ex-girlfriends who said he was too spoiled and a Momma's boy, tells his father that he was no longer taking any money from him. His father was delighted that his last only unmarred offspring was going to stand on his own two feet.

                    In season 12, he asks his father to find him a wife and he ends up going with Anu.

                    <h4 id="Trivia">Trivia</h4>
                    Raj was the only one of the four (Howard, Leonard, himself and Sheldon) whose father appeared til Leonard's father debuted. <br/> <br/> Howard's father's only been mentioned and Sheldon's died before the start of the series (dying when Sheldon was 14) but Raj sees his father with his mother through his webcam. Once he visited Pasadena at Christmas time.
                    <br/> <br/>  He has a Ph.D. in Astrophysics.<br/>
                    <br/>  The baseball cap Raj wears in the Pilot bears the number 42 (the answer to life, the universe and everything) on it. This was Raj's only baseball cap appearance.
                    <br/>  <br/>         Raj is 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall [1] and the height of Kunal Nayyar. This measurement is two inches above the average height for males in India, one-and-a-half inches below the average height for male private school students in India, and two inches below the average height for males in the US. In "The Transporter Malfunction", he states that, next to Howard and Bernadette, he looks 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m) tall.
                    <br/><br/> Til season 10, He lives in an apartment, which he calls his "Raj Mahal" when Penny visits.
                    <br/> <br/>Raj isn't at all serious about his Hindu faith and eats beef which is frowned upon by most Hindus.
                    <br/><br/>   Raj calls his skin tone "Melt-In-Your-Mouth Caramel".
                    <br/>  Raj, much like Howard, despises many of Sheldon's antics and the two managed to get Sheldon on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler on a dating website in "The Lunar Excitation", much to Sheldon's dismay.
                    <br/>        <br/> Raj's case of selective mutism was first evident in the Pilot episode.
                    <br/><br/> "Rajesh" is a common given name in southern India; however Raj claims that he is from New Delhi, suggesting either that his family moved from their native area or ignorance on the part of the creators. His surname, "Koothrappali"; however is unheard of. This is most likely assumed to be a surname used in South India, particularly Tamil Nadu.
                    <br/>     <br/>Whenever Raj gets an idea or wants to say something slightly controversial in a conversation, he whispers it in Howard's ear if a woman is around. Howard never wants to say it out loud because he finds it stupid or offensive, but he ends up saying it anyway through scoffing Raj. Sheldon hates him talking in his ear altogether, although he does appreciate Raj's words.
                    <br/>          <br/>Raj says that he "struggles with Batman."
                    <br/>   <br/>  He regularly communicates with his parents (V. M. Koothrappali and Mrs. Koothrappali) back in India via webcam. When they become meddling or judgmental, he often "brings his parents" into Leonard and Sheldon's Apartment 4A via his MacBook Pro, to seek his friends' support in the discussion.
                    <br/><br/>  He has a mug that says 'World's Best Astrophysicist' given to him by Sheldon.
                    <br/> <br/>His father is a gynecologist and drives a Bentley.
                    <br/> <br/> Raj shares his interest in monkeys with Amy and Sheldon and trains with Sheldon.
                                       <br/><br/> Rajesh often has married-couple-like arguments with Howard and when nervous, often whispers into his ear leaving him to translate to everyone else.
                    <br/><br/>As with Howard, the others in his circle of friends often refer to him by his surname. He frequently wears a purple jacket and a sweater vest. Amy calls him Rajesh.
                    <br/><br/>   Rajesh's selective mutism even applies in dreams. Most notable is with Siri. ("The Beta Test Initiation").
                    <br/>    <br/>Rajesh performs vocals when playing "Rock Band" (albeit extremely badly), which could possibly be a joke cause he suffers from selective mutism. Though in a Season 2 promotional photo, he's playing with a guitar controller, so he's either playing the bass or the lead.
                    <br/> <br/> He despises "Guitar Hero" cause he feels it's lame though he plays it.
                    <br/> <br/>   Raj is considered the attractive one of the group because women find him foreign and exotic, plus his selective mutism makes him a very "good listener."
                    <br/> <br/>  He worked with/for Sheldon.
                    <br/>    <br/>  He has been featured in People Magazine ("30 Under 30 to Watch!").
                    <br/> <br/> He has a MySpace account.
                    <br/> <br/>    In seasons 1 - 6, he has issues talking to women unless he is drunk. In "The Porkchop Indeterminacy", he tried an experimental medication for his problem, but stopped taking it because of the side effects. In "The Wildebeest Implementation", he tried another medication he got from a friend at Caltech's school of pharmacology but gave up on it too cause it removed his social inhibitions to the point that he stripped naked in the middle of a coffee shop which should've gotten him arrested.
                    <br/> <br/>   Unlike the other guys, Raj has shown great interest in some non-geeky and sometimes feminine things, such as Grey's Anatomy, The Good Wife, Sex and the City, Bat Pray Love, Bridget Jones' Diary and John Grisham's novels. He also likes Archie comics along with Zack and likes Twilight.
                    <br/>   <br/>  Raj is addicted to porn. However, Howard early on also has disturbing sexual obsessions.
                    <br/>  <br/>    He dislikes Aquaman, as he is always chosen to dress as Aquaman when they have a costume competition and outside the comic book store to advertise the store while he was working for Stuart.
                    <br/> <br/>  He calls Scooter of the Muppet Babies "The Aquaman of the Muppet Babies"
                    <br/> <br/>  Raj often obsesses over almost-insignificant details in fiction, such as how toilets in Atlantis in Aquaman work, the possible symbolism of ponytails in Avatar, whether Wolverine's prostate is made of adamantium, what zombies would eat if humanity were exterminated, how vampires would shave themselves if they can't see their reflections etc.
                    <br/><br/>  English is his native language, though due to being from India, he speaks fluent Hindi. Raj doesn't actually speak Hindi as mentioned in "The Cognition Regeneration".
                    <br/> <br/> Raj doesn't need to be drunk to talk to women: he just has to think he is drunk (Placebo Effect), as shown in "The Terminator Decoupling".
                    <br/>      <br/> Raj takes Pilates classes and Aerobics and claims to, as a result, have "very well-trained abs".
                    <br/> <br/> In one scene, when his parents arranged a blind date, he refused and Sheldon explains that Indian arranged marriages result in a peaceful bond. Raj then says "I know my own culture", leaving Sheldon silenced.
                    <br/> <br/>  In one episode, Sheldon joins Penny in jogging and Howard tells Penny that Raj always watches her from his car with binoculars.
                    <br/>   <br/> Like the common geek, Raj was bullied as a child. He once got a penis drawn on his forehead on his first day of cricket camp, with the testicles drawn around the eyes. One person who bullied him was Lalita Gupta, who used to kick him in the nuts and call him "untouchable." They dated as adults, where a drunk Raj insults her by saying she used to be so, so fat as a child.
                    <br/>   <br/> His favorite number is 5,318,008. The reason for that is that when entered in a calculator, turning the calculator upside-down will read "BOOBIES".
                    <br/> <br/>    Raj's terrified of bugs as he is women, Sheldon jokes that ladybugs must render him catatonic.
                    <br/>            <br/>  He was mad when Leonard and Priya decided to date again which means he's overprotective towards his baby sister and is worried how terribly this could affect his friendship with Leonard.
                    <br/> <br/>    He is a fan of country-pop singer Taylor Swift and bought a jersey at her concert at the Staples Center.
                    <br/>  <br/> In "The Roommate Transmogrification", Raj had a drunken sexual encounter with Penny, which they both apparently regretted instantly. (It is later on revealed, in the premiere of Season 5, that it wasn't consummated.) This would later become the catalyst of conflict between Penny and Emily Sweeney.
                    <br/><br/>  It is revealed in two episodes during Season 4 and the Season 5 premiere that Raj had a huge crush on Bernadette.
                    <br/>   <br/>     Sheldon revealed that Raj's family's "Richie Rich" rich.
                    <br/> <br/>     He's afraid of spiders, revealed in "The Alien Parasite Hypothesis".
                    <br/>      <br/> Even though Raj does not adhere to Hindu dietary restrictions, he does take certain aspects of his religion seriously and has brought up Hindu gods more than once in a conversation.
                    <br/> <br/>       Raj's selective mutism doesn't seem to apply to his female family members such as his mother and his sister Priya.
                    <br/>       <br/>   Raj is the group's "historian", being able to keep record of many actions - for instance, in "The Hawking Excitation", Raj was able to recount how many times Sheldon has begged in the past.
                    <br/> <br/> Raj has had one threesome in his life. It was with Howard and a 200-pound girl in a Sailor Moon costume during a trip to Comic-Con.
                    <br/><br/>   According to Lakshmi, the woman Raj goes out on a date with in "The Transporter Malfunction", there is a rumor back in New Delhi that Raj is "comfortable in a sari" (i.e. he is gay).
                    <br/>     <br/>  In "The Bakersfield Expedition", Raj dressed as the a Klingon from Star Trek: The Next Generation.
                    <br/><br/>    Raj's drink of choice has remained the grasshopper since he was first served it in "The Grasshopper Experiment": he can be seen drinking one in numerous episodes thereafter.
                    <br/> <br/>   Raj owns a female Yorkshire Terrier named Cinnamon. She was given to him by Howard and Bernadette in "The Transporter Malfunction" to console him over his failed date with Lakshmi. Raj spoils Cinnamon terribly, feeding her elaborate home-cooked meals and pushing her around in a baby stroller.
                    <br/> <br/>  It is revealed that in "The Prestidigitation Approximation" that Raj keeps a Uhura costume on hand in his closet; a source of great shame for his family. "Leonard: Hypothetically, if I had access to a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it? Priya: Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe."
                    <br/><br/> Bernadette, Raj, Leonard, Penny and Amy are the only characters of the social group/main cast whose parents have both been seen on-camera - Sheldon's father died when Sheldon was a child, Howard's father abandoned him and his mother when Howard was eleven, Stuart's mother and father have been mentioned and are both alive, Emily's father has been mentioned and it is not known if he is dead or alive and there has been no appearance or mention of Emily's mother or Leslie's mother and father to date.
                    <br/>  <br/>   However Sheldon's parents appeared in the prequel, "Young Sheldon".
                    <br/> <br/>   Raj is possibly the only member of the guys not to be arrested. Leonard nearly committed treason by nearly showing rocket fuel to Joyce Kim and blew up the elevator by accident with his rocket fuel along with speeding one episode. Howard destroyed the Mars Rover, not to mention other illegal activities such as using government property for his personal use. Sheldon was thrown in jail for insulting a judge in traffic court and has had several restraining orders filed against him by various celebrities (such as Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye etc). In "The Convention Conundrum", it was revealed that Raj fears being arrested out of fear of being deported back to India. However Raj has had several incidents with Human Resources at Caltech and has committed enough crimes to be fired if not arrested.
                    <br/>  <br/>  He drives a BMW with seat warmers.
                    <br/><br/>   Regarding Bollywood}actresses, Raj describes Aishwarya Rai as a "goddess" and prefers her over Madhuri Dixit.
                    <br/> <br/>  Raj, Leonard, Sheldon and Howard are the only characters of the current main cast who have appeared in every episode (not counting the Unaired Pilot).
                    <br/><br/>  Raj may be an olfactophile which is shown in "The Gothowitz Deviation".
                    <br/><br/>   Tighty-whities are his underwear of choice, as seen in "The Wildebeest Implementation" and "The Monster Isolation". He mentioned he wore Boxer Shorts in season 1 in "The Grasshopper Experiment", but you actually see him wear it.
                    <br/>  <br/>  The only episode where Raj doesn't talk in at all is the Season 3 episode "The Maternal Congruence".
                    <br/><br/>    In "The Allowance Evaporation", Raj's friends about talking about where he would live, if he had to move out of his apartment. He was the only person in the series, who lives alone. Howard and Bernadette don't want to live with him and neither does Leonard and Penny. Because he is too difficult to live with and he is a lot worse to live with than Sheldon Cooper.
                    <br/><br/>    In season 10, "The Escape Hatch Identification" Raj moved out his apartment, since he can't afford to live there anymore since he cut himself off his parent's finances in "The Allowance Evaporation". Mostly he is staying with Leonard and Penny apartment temporary, until he can find a place to stay. Even though Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny don't want to live with him, since he is difficult to live with, like living with Sheldon Cooper. One time, Leonard and Penny will let him stay with him temporary til he finds a place of his own.
                    <br/> <br/>   Raj's job earns average $55,000 to $93,000 annually in the US; therefore, it's unknown why he has to depend on his dad for money all the time. He has a very expensive lifestyle and beauty regiment.
                    <br/> <br/>   Raj is right-handed.
                    <br/><br/>  Raj in season 11, had a good relationship with his parents when he was growing up. When he was an adult, mostly they have an estranged relationship and usually threatened to cut him off. Mostly they always trying to arrange an Indian girl for him to marry. In season 10, they gave up on finding him a girl.
                    <br/><br/>  As of the series finale, Raj is the only main character who is single, as Stuart has a girlfriend Denise and the other guys are married to the girls in the group.
                    <br/><br/>  In season 2, Raj couldn't stand living with Sheldon and wants him out o his apartment. In season 4, when he stayed with Sheldon he never complained or wanted to strangle him. Mostly I think Raj's personality changed in season 4 when he becomes needy, pushy and arrogant like Sheldon. He also makes many disturbing remarks.
