                        <h2 id="Biography">BIOGRAPHY</h2> <br/>
                    Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper, B.Sc., M.Sc., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D., is a Caltech theoretical physicist. Next to his best friend Leonard Hofstadter, he's the main protagonist of The Big Bang Theory and the protagonist of Young Sheldon.

                    Originally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving his first Ph.D. at the age of 16. As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a "wunderkind", such as his plan to provide free electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan stopped by government pen pushers claiming it's illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly geeky, he has no qualms about speaking Klingon, wearing vintage t-shirts sporting superhero logos, or spouting various historical and cultural anecdotes (e.g., his account of the introduction of the fork into Thailand). While he might claim to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have his faults. Sheldon is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene; an overly intellectual personality; a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor; and a general lack of humility or empathy, the former of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his admiration for his superior intellect. These qualities, along with his penchant for pranks, are his character's main source of humor. He's often considered to be the most iconic character of the show. Sheldon has developed a more human personality due to the influences of his friend Penny and his wife Amy but some of it doesn't always show up.
                <br />
                <br />
                    Sheldon was born alongside his twin sister Missy on February 26, 1980 in a Kmart in Galveston, Texas to George Cooper Sr. and Mary Cooper, and was officiated at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital. He has an older brother named George Jr., who, along with Missy, is described by their mother to be "dumb as soup". Sheldon was raised according to his mother's Evangelical Christian doctrines, (i.e.; learning how to pray and becoming the co-captain of the East Texan Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League Championship team and seven-to-twelve year-old division). Meanwhile, he was forced to watch football by his father.

                        <h4 id="Early_Life"> Early Life</h4>

                    Like any typical nerd, Sheldon was bullied a lot during his childhood, mostly because he constantly expressed intellectual superiority to his peers as he still does now. The bullying consisted of, but was not limited to, being beaten up, getting swirlies (even in church), noogies and wedgies, and having his personal belongings stolen. This is further accentuated when he tells Amy Farrah Fowler that the memories of his upbringing were tantamount to that of an insufferably tantalizing "hell". Further anecdotes also reveal that he built a so-called "Sonic Death Ray" that didn't even slow down the neighbor kids (all it did was annoy their dog), and constructed an armed robot using integrated circuits from ceramic semiconductor substrates cooked in Missy's modified Easy-Bake Oven, to defend his room from Missy (whose eyebrows were burned off as a result of a malfunction). Sheldon was also beaten up by his brother and sister, with Missy usually kicking Sheldon in his crotch.

            <br/><br/>        As a kid, Sheldon wrote a paper entitled "A Proof That Algebraic Topology Can Never Have a Non-self-contradictory Set of Abelian Groups" and his grade school science project paper, with the original title "A Rederivation of Maxwell’s Equations Regarding Electromagnetism", contains an approach that might change the way how ferromagnetic hysteresis is calculated. Despite his misgivings about being called a 'rocket scientist' as an adult, at nine years old, the boy genius wrote "Rocket Reentry & Retropropulsion" in a composition notebook; this provides the solution to the VTVL problem discreetly employed by Elon Musk years later for his successful SpaceX CRS-8 mission. While Sheldon audited Dr. John Sturgis' quantum chromodynamics course at East Texas Tech at nine years old as Medford High School no longer academically challenged him, Sheldon formally entered college at the age of eleven. At age twelve, filled with disappointment at not receiving a titanium centrifuge to separate radioactive isotopes, he had to be flown to a hospital by helicopter to be treated for radiation burns following a mishap when he built a CAT scanner (which also resulted in the death of his sister's guinea pig, Snowball). He also, at this time, conducted experiments involving the height of stairs only to deduce that if a step on a staircase is two millimeters off or more, a person is likely to trip - his findings evidenced by his father breaking his clavicle. When Sheldon was thirteen, he attempted to build a nuclear reactor in order to provide free electricity for his town, but it failed after a government agent informed him that it was illegal to store Yellowcake uranium in a shed; he then had a big tantrum as a result. During that same year, he walked in on his father having sex with a woman who was not his wife, and he never said anything about it to Sheldon, and Sheldon decided to start knocking three times to prevent walking in on anything like that again. When Sheldon was fourteen years old, he graduated college East Texas Tech summa cum laude, began graduate school at the California Institute of Technology, and was the youngest person at the time to receive the Stevenson Award at "fourteen and a half." He received his first doctorate at the age of sixteen, and he then spent four years on his second dissertation before obtaining his current position.

          <br/><br/>          Sheldon formerly loathed birthday parties cause he shared his birthday with his twin sister. Missy and her childhood friends tricked Sheldon that Batman was coming and he waited the whole afternoon at the door and all that came was a robin that flew in the window. He never wanted one after that, until his friends threw him an enjoyable birthday party in "The Celebration Experimentation".

                    Since the age of 9, he'd been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider ("The Large Hadron Collision" (S3E15)).

                    In 1994 or 1995, Sheldon's father died due to weight problems. In "The Pancake Batter Anomaly" (S1E11), Sheldon said, at the age of 15, he got sick in Germany, and his mother had to fly back to Texas to help his dad at that time. This creates a continuity error in the episodes "The Thanksgiving Decoupling" (S7E9) and "The Proton Transmogrification" (S7E22) cause Sheldon mentions to Bernadette's father Mike and to the ghost of Professor Proton, respectively, that his father died when he was 14.

                    When Sheldon graduated from College at 14, he got accepted into Caltech. Though he was planning to move in together with Tam, Tam found a girlfriend and decided to stay in Texas instead. This is why Sheldon hasn't spoken to Tam for a long time.

                    It's unknown when he moved into the apartment with Sebastian before he drove him out and he met Stuart and the comic book store.

                    In 2003, Leonard moved in with Sheldon after all his roommates before couldn't stand him.
