                    <h2 id="Biography">     BIOGRAPHY <br/></h2>
                    Howard Joel Wolowitz, M.Eng., is a Jewish aerospace engineer and ex-astronaut. He is the son of an overbearing mother, Debbie Wolowitz, who couldn't care less about his scientific accomplishments and still talks to him as if he were a child. As the best friend of Rajesh Koothrappali, Howard often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment with him. Although he's the only member of the group lacking a doctoral degree, he defends himself by pointing out that he not only has a master's degree in Engineering from MIT, but also designs important devices like the "space toilet" and telescope used at the International Space Station and components for satellites and space probes. Fancying himself a smooth ladies' man, Howard is rather confident in trying to woo girls (unlike the other three), mostly through creepy overtures and sometimes with his knowledge of foreign languages, of which he knows seven (if you count Klingon). During the show, he dates and eventually marries Bernadette, with whom he bonded over their dislike towards their overbearing mothers and has been influenced to tone down his creepy behavior. Much later, the couple have a daughter named Halley Wolowitz and a son named Neil Michael Wolowitz.
                <br />
                <br />
                    <h4 id="Early_Life">
                        Early Life <br/> </h4>    Howard was born in Pasadena sometime between March 1-September 30, 1981 to Sam and Debbie Wolowitz. When Howard was in kindergarten, his mother made him wear rubber gloves there so he wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children. When Howard was 11, his father left for an unknown reason and Howard spent his adolescence looking out of the window waiting for him to return one day, but he never did. Howard's childhood was lonely and he was bullied back then with wedgies and swirlies, one of his bullies being Scott Kapinski.

          <h4 id="Character">Characterisation</h4>


                    Cheeky, tenderhearted and supposedly suave, Howard provides outrageous techniques in an attempt to get girls in the first three seasons, none of which are remotely successful. Howard's techniques to approach women are varied, including magic and card tricks, ventriloquism, and techniques from the Mystery Method, such as peacocking and negging. He is consistently depicted as the most sex-crazed of the guys, although he doesn't think his sexual behavior is any different from other men. One time, he developed a mathematical formula for the likelihood of him having sex by applying and modifying the Drake equation to include the "Wolowitz coefficient," which he defined as "neediness times dress size squared." He stated, "I'm a horny engineer... I never joke about math or sex." He often fantasizes about several actresses, including Katee Sackhoff, but apparently every woman is his type. Howard describes himself as a romantic, although he usually comes across as overtly sexual and, in Penny's words, disgusting.

                 <br/><br/>   Later Howard becomes dedicated to Bernadette, although he still uses pick-up lines. He reveals more of his facets to Bernadette. As part of his delusions regarding himself, he opines that he is a "tender-hearted poet" and "crazy daredevil". He claims to appear confident and worldly, though he admits he is not. Also, in the first three seasons, he often put chasing women ahead of his friends, a fact that often annoyed them. Examples of this were seen such as when he chose to have sex with Leslie Winkle instead of covering his friends during paintball, getting them shredded. Also, he chose to chase a woman instead of help Raj during a kite competition, costing Raj a kite that he had been sent from India.

                    Howard is multilingual, using many tongues to try to impress the ladies, sadly to little avail. Most of the languages were revealed in the pilot; in revealed order, they are English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Howard also speaks Klingon (and plays Klingon Boggle). As shown in "The Wiggly Finger Catalyst", he also knows sign language, and in "The Hawking Excitation", he speaks Japanese and Binary-coded ASCII. However, Howard may not be as competent a polyglot as he believes. In "The Dumpling Paradox", the owner of Szechuan Palace referred to Howard as "...your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin." As evidence, he addressed Penny in Mandarin (saying "洗个痛快澡"! - Have a Good Shower!") spoken in the wrong tones. Another time, he addressed Penny in Russian (saying "Ты очень красивая девушка" — "You are a very beautiful girl"), but used bad pronunciation. Sheldon also corrected him in "The Hawking Excitation"," when Howard made a mistake in binary. On the contrary, he speaks his French without any speaking errors.
                    <br/><br/>


                    At a cost of his alleged suaveness, Howard can be obnoxious, flippantly derisive and arrogant to an extreme: before he met Bernadette, he made a constant habit of mocking and belittling Leonard about his relationship with Penny as if it had no chance of progressing, completely ignoring the fact that he himself was not in a relationship for the sake of seeming superior to somebody else. Also, when he makes any an accomplishment that he can lord over other people, he will relentlessly remind people about it - most commonly, he brags about having been to space and being the designer for technology that boarded the International Space Station. This particular factor goes to such an extent that people find his bragging extremely annoying and gratuitous, but he barely seems to notice how incessantly he is talking about it. This mostly stemmed from the belief that going into space would be the greatest accomplishment he will ever achieve, and not being able to discuss it would, in his opinion, downgrade its value to him. In spite of this, Howard seemed to believe that simply being an astronaut who went to space made him an American hero.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In addition, after he met Bernadette, he first started treating her like a house-wife and when she stated it felt like it wasn't her house, he answered Of course it's your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time? and expects her to cater to him in the same way his mother did. He even shamelessly admitted that he'd hoped that, when he met a girl, she would be more like Megan Fox from Transformers (Who is an extremely attractive, but notoriously objectified person, indicating a slightly male-chauvinistic streak). He also tended to act extremely childishly, being lazy enough that Bernadette even set up a 'chore chart' for every time he helped around the house, but even then he only did the bare minimum of housework and expected Bernadette to do it instead. Where his father Sam Wolowitz is concerned, Howard has an extremely complex attitude and opinion. He is repeatedly shown to be furious and resentful towards his father for abandoning him to live with his mother, which is understandable. When he discovers a letter from his father and learns that Sheldon had prematurely read it, his ultimate reaction is to burn the letter cause he doesn't want to hear anything that his father has to say, but he is even angrier when he becomes the only one who has no idea what was in the letter. When he meets his half-brother by his father's relationship with another woman, Howard experiences shock at the discovery that his father had another, visibly developed family. In spite of this, Howard is extremely shameless in this regard and will deliberately use his father's abandonment of him to extricate sympathy out of other people, which is often perceived as shallow and melodramatic.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Once Howard finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it. Sheldon even describes him as the funny one in their group, while Howard has said of himself that he is quirky. He mimics voices such as Raj's Indian accent and his mother's accent, and often spews cultural stereotypes. He uses slang such as "fo’shizzle to my nerdizzles," demonstrating his supposed street cred. Howard often has married-couple-like arguments with Raj, usually mocking his words or covering for his obnoxiousness, and is the primary means by which Raj is heard whenever Penny is present. Very sensitive, Howard can be traumatized by a hurtful comment from a woman and there is a glimmer of goodness in him that he allowed Penny to see. In fairness, when this actually happened with Penny, he entirely deserved it because he was making insensitive, borderline misogynistic suggestions towards her and had done so at multiple opportunities in the past, and couldn't even notice that he was being conceited and insulting towards her. Howard's misogyny has also had violent consequences - when Penny engaged in a ferocious brawl with Alicia, Howard screamed with excitement at seeing a girl-fight and immediately restrained Leonard out of terror that he would try to break it up - the fight resulted in Penny receiving several brutal injuries and Howard never had the decency to apologize for his part in her injuries, yet he said something to please her.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Howard spends a large amount of time playing MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, where he plays a night elf hunter named Wolowizard with a pet tiger named Buttons, and Age of Conan where he is a Guardian named "Sir Howard of Wolowitz". Howard enjoys (and is very decent at) Dance Dance Revolution|DDR. He likes reading comics, similar to his friends, and is a Dungeon Master. He has an entire closet of magic tricks. A model rocket enthusiast, Howard designed the engine himself for a three-stage rocket. His advancements in robotics include the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator (MONTE) for the Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational. He also once sent a signal around the world via the Internet just to turn on a lamp. He is asthmatic, allergic to peanuts, almonds and walnuts, prone to canker sores and pink eye, succumbs to seasickness, has an incredibly high genetic risk of heart illness and has transient idiopathic arrhythmia. His small size and thin build are also the source of many jokes for people who know him. Aside from being a huge Neil Diamond fan, along with Amy, Howard is heavily implied to enjoy The Beatles due to his "Ringo" haircut and them being on his personalized CD disc.

                <h4 id="Family">Family</h4>
                    Howard is noted for living with his overbearing Jewish mother Debbie Wolowitz (to Howard she lives with him), who always makes his life miserable at home with her nosy nature as well as her barrage of disturbing questions, and apparently is oblivious to his accomplishments as a grown-up, usually treating him like he is still a child, thus filling the stereotype of a Jewish mother. Never seen on-screen except for an overhead glimpse in the Season Five finale, and a late season Six episode where she is seen from behind through an ajar door no less than three times. She only communicates with Howard by yelling to him in an obnoxious manner, which results in awkward long-distance conversations, with Howard frustratingly yelling back at her. Such behavior prompts him to call her a "crazy old lady". Howard stated that she had safety bars on his bed until he was seventeen in the Season Two finale. Despite this fact, Howard likes to be mothered to some degree, has an unresolved Oedipus complex and seems to appreciate some of his mother's cooking, especially her brisket, a dish that Howard refers to throughout (unlike the turbriskefilte, a turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with Gefilte fish, which he says he 'doesn't even chew', but 'swallows like pills'). It is implied strongly that his mom is incredibly fat and disturbingly masculine, causing Leonard to believe she was Howard's dad when he first heard her. It has been stated that she also has a large mustache. Despite the fact that she made his life miserable by emotionally suffocating him and that he often wished for her death, it is shown he truly loved his mother as shown when he worried for her health after she got food poisoning and was jealous of her spending time with Stuart Bloom. During "The Comic Book Store Regeneration," Howard was devastated by the news that his mother died in her sleep while visiting relatives in Florida as he was comforted by his friends.

                    <br/><br/>     In "The Precious Fragmentation", Howard reveals that his father left his family when Howard was eleven. To help Howard overcome the loss, his mom bought him an Alf doll to console Howard. Although it is not stated what really happened, Howard assumes that his father did not like him. In "The Hot Troll Deviation", Howard infers that the cause of why he "tries too hard" with women is due to abandonment issues, as opposed to the proximal cause being his looks (as stated in "The Killer Robot Instability"): "I’m just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was eleven." His parents were drunk all the time and it has never been established why his father left.

                    <br/><br/>    Howard lost his virginity to his second cousin Jeanie in a Toyota Corolla after they locked eyes over the pickled herring at his Aunt Barbara's house during his Uncle Murray's funeral, and ever since Howard gets aroused by looking at pickled herring, all of which Leonard and Raj find extremely funny. His cousin David provided him with the half-carat ring for Bernadette.

                    <br/><br/>   He has a cousin in Israel who lives with her husband Avi, as well as cousins from Fort Lauderdale, while his Aunt Betty (his mother's sister) and Uncle Elliot are from Palm Springs. Howard also has an Uncle Louie, whom he ridicules based on a photo of him in a bathing suit. He says they are "Jewish hobbits," as evidenced by dinner at his house on Rosh Hashanah. After Howard's great-grandfather immigrated to the United States, he ran a little butcher shop on the Lower East Side of New York, ripping people off. Howard's family has a genetically high risk of heart disease. In "The Closet Reconfiguration" Sheldon finds an unopened letter from Howard's father that he read. Eventually, everyone knows what is in the letter except Howard, who had burnt it earlier in the episode. When Howard tells them he both wants and does not want to know the contents, his friends come up with a compromise. They each tell him a plausible story, only one of which is the actual truth, so he hears the contents, but isn't sure which one (except for Sheldon's version.) In "The Comic Book Store Regeneration", Howard learns that his mother died in her sleep while visiting Howard's Aunt Gladys in Florida. He and Bernadette fly to Florida for the funeral and the airline temporarily loses his mother's urn with her ashes in it. Howard is distort because he didn't get to see her one last time because he was too busy to drive her to the airport. Howard promises that they will never be separated again making Bernadette fear that the urn will end up in their bedroom.

                    <br/><br/>      In "The Fortification Implementation," a young man shows up at Howard's door and has just learned through the lawyer handling Howard's mother's estate that Howard was his older half-brother. Their mutual father, Sam Wolowitz is revealed to have had a second family after leaving Howard's mother with his name being Josh Wolowitz and he is an oceanography student in San Diego. Though it is awkward at first, as Howard was hurt his father had another family when he left his old one. Initially, Howard wanted Josh to go away though the two half-brothers bonded after Josh learned of Howard being an astronaut which he found to be amazing. This flattered Howard who told him of his time as an astronaut. Howard was even more pleased with Josh having a similar creepy personality that Howard used to have, which helped them connect. After that any discomfort Howard had with Josh disappeared, as he acknowledged Josh as his younger brother and hugged Josh hoping to see him again though he didn't appear again in the series.

                    <br/><br/>  In "The Birthday Synchronicity", Bernadette is rushed to the hospital and gives birth to their daughter Halley Wolowitz. In "The Proposal Proposal”, when Sheldon calls about his engagement to Amy, Howard tells Bernie who discovers that moment that she again pregnant. Howard thinks that she is crying about the engagement. When she tells they start several rounds of "No" and "Yes" with both of them wondering if they can raise another baby.

                    <br/><br/>   In "The Explosion Implosion", they learn their unborn child was going to be a boy as Howard is worried he won't be manly enough to raise a boy. After a talk with Sheldon, he overcomes his worries and prepares to raise another child with his wife.

                    <br/><br/>   During "The Neonatal Nomenclature", Howard and Bernadette's son Neil Michael Wolowitz is born and Bernadette has already decided to call him by his middle name, something Howard argues with.

              <h4 id="Trivia">Trivia</h4>

                    He's the only one of the group other than Penny and Stuart to lack a PhD, he's often mocked by Sheldon and others for this which is ironic considering he wasn't requiring any to be well above the latter two and even Stuart makes progress in the last 2 seasons. Howard eventually calls engineers as smart as physicists to Sheldon's horror. Howard, ironically has at least better sarcasm understanding than Sheldon.
                    On a shelf in Howard's room, there is a replica model of the 211-V Plasma Cutter used by Isaac Clarke in the first Dead Space game. The tool is also seen being used in Dead Space 2 by a girl named Ellie Langford which she fires at Isaac in Hostility.
                    Howard has a master's degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.
                    His astronaut nickname has been designated as "Froot Loops".
                    Howard has a different chest hair count in "The Cushion Saturation" and "The 21-Second Excitation".
                    Howard wears alien pins on his collar in every episode, yet the pin has not been mentioned thus far.
                    Though Howard's Jewish, like Rajesh Koothrappali he doesn't seem to take his faith seriously and hardly keeps Kosher.
                    Howard's committed the most illegal acts of the group yet has apparently never gotten imprisoned nor even fired for it. He has a large amount of sexual harassment complaints, destroyed government property (driving the Mars Rover into a ditch and destroying the data), stolen government property for his own use (using a spare camera from the Mars rover to spy on Sheldon, diverting a satellite to find the Top Models mansion), unlawful surveillance (installing cameras to spy on women, such as giving Penny a webcam teddy bear and installing cameras in the hallway to spy on Penny.) Interestingly, Howard's destruction of the Mars Rover is revealed by Sheldon to the FBI yet Howard is never actually arrested for the act. In double irony the university never fires him either and considering all Howard's crimes, firing him was the minimum that should've happened.
                    Howard is 5 ft 4 in (1.63 m) tall [1], the height of Simon Helberg. After Leonard teased him regarding his small stature in "The Hot Troll Deviation", he stated that Leonard, who is established to be 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m), was only about a quarter of an inch taller than him.
                    He weighs around 120 pounds.
                    Howard and his mother live in Altadena, California, north of Pasadena, until he moves out in "The Habitation Configuration" (S6E07) after he was married.
                    Howard wears Vans and Converse shoes. * Wolowitz is a huge fan of Stephen Hawking and likes to watch tapes of his lectures, preferably ones prior to 1985, "before he became a 'creepy' computer voice" (Hawking lost his voice due to a tracheotomy performed after a life-threatening bout of pneumonia and now communicates using a voice synthesizer). In "The Hawking Excitation", Howard actually gets the chance to meet and work with him, helping him with his wheelchair equipment. Howard would later recommend Leonard to Hawking for his North Sea expedition, which Hawking agreed to.
                    Howard's online username/persona/identity is Wolowizard.
                    Howard spends a large amount of time playing MMORPGs like World of Warcraft, where he plays a night elf hunter named Wolowizard with a pet tiger named Buttons. He also plays Age of Conan where he is a Guardian named Sir Howard of Wolowitz.
                    Howard enjoys (and is very good at) DDR.
                    Howard is allergic to peanuts and when he does eat one, his face goes pink and swells up very badly. * Howard owns an Alienware computer.
                    Howard has a Dell XPS M1210 with a 6 Cell Battery.
                    Howard owns a Motorola V3, Nokia N95 and various iPhone cell phones.
                    Howard has two Luke Skywalker FX lightsabers displayed on the wall of his bedroom, which he can ignite by remote to set the mood. In the flashback of Howard's room in 2003, he had two plastic toy blue light sabers on the wall, likely replaced later on with the FX sabers.
                    Howard's personal wardrobe and grooming styles are based on Davy Jones from The Monkees, usually including a 1960s hip bowl-style haircut (even though he chose to have a '70s disco style Afro and goat beard 7 years ago) and a brightly colored shirt.
                    Howard can beatbox, albeit badly.
                    The character is named after show producer Bill Prady's former business partner in a software development company, Howard Wolowitz.
                    Howard maintains that his mother lived with him, rather than him having lived with his mother.
                    Howard gets around Pasadena by means of gas-powered scooter-Vespa though he may have gotten a car because in "The Robotic Manipulation" he states that he smuggled the robotic arm to his car. He does gets a new car in "The Parking Spot Escalation".
                    He has a massive collection of belt buckles yet only has one belt.
                    Howard's collection of belt buckles include a chimpanzee, deli sandwich, a film projector, Nintendo controller and the 'Superman Returns' shield. Many of his belt buckles are purchased from thealley.com
                    Howard plays the drums on Rock Band.
                    Howard once went to medical school but dropped out cause he easily gets nauseated when he sees injuries (as seen in "The White Asparagus Triangulation" when he appears sick when he sees stitches on Leonard's hand).
                    Howard says in "The Friendship Algorithm" that he's thinking about growing a mustache but it's not til "The Electric Can Opener Fluctuation" he appears with one, having grown a massive beard at the North Pole and keeping the mustache when they shave their beards off.
                    According to "The Apology Insufficiency", his middle name is Joel.
                    In "The Alien Parasite Hypothesis", Howard mentions having taken a karate lesson when he was 11. He claims that he could have become more proficient if his mother could have arranged a carpool.
                    Howard was bullied as a child. He received the common treatment of wedgies and swirlies.
                    His nightmare is to shower after the game and for other guys see him naked.
                    Howard bears similarities to comedian Moe Howard, such as his haircut, name and Jewish heritage.
                    Though considered the least smart member of the guys for not having a doctorate other than Stuart, Howard appears to be smarter than his friends acknowledge him as, such as besting Sheldon at insect biology in Season 3's second episode. He also states in "The Hawking Excitation" that he has a valid understanding of physics. He has a greater knowledge or designing and building real life things and can advise Penny as easily as the others
                    He, on one instance, was vengeful to Sheldon for saying he couldn't understand Physics, not letting him see Stephen Hawking and shunning him in Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Klingon, Binary Code and Gangsta ("Hells Naw").
                    Despite his many creepy sexual fantasies of Penny during the earlier series, he ironically remains the only one of the original group that hasn't seen Penny naked. Leonard has seen Penny naked many times due to them dating, being engaged and now married, Sheldon during "The Adhesive Duck Deficiency" and Raj when he 'slept' with her and saw her naked. Not from a lack of trying, such as when he gave Penny a teddy-bear that had a webcam in it. However, Sheldon revealed that right after the guys met Penny, Howard had found the movie "Serial Ape-ist" online, which depicted Penny topless.
                    Both Howard and Sheldon connect with their girlfriends over the personalities of their mothers.
                    He's the first one of the geeks to get married, the first to get engaged and to have kids.
                    Howard may be the basis for Miho Hidaka from the manga/anime series Prodigy Teacher Yuto.
                    Bill Prady described Howard as perfecting Pepe Le Pew, the skunk from Looney Tunes, who constantly tried to get a girl to love him.
                    At age 15, Howard lost his virginity to his second cousin Jeanie in her father's Toyota Corolla.
                    Howard's Bar Mitsvah bonds consist of $2,600 and two trees in Israel.
                    His mother calls him 'Bubula'.
                    Out of all the main cast (Himself, Sheldon, Raj, Leonard, Stuart, Amy, Bernadette and Penny), he's the only one that was actually born in Pasadena (Sheldon's from Texas, Raj's from India, Leonard's from New Jersey, Penny's from Nebraska. Stuart's Origin's unknown but has strongly been hinted to be in Rhode Island; Amy's from Glendale and Bernadette's from Yorba Linda).
                    Some of Howard's "flirts" included:
                    "See a Penny, pick her up and all the day you'll have good luck."
                    (Howard was dressed as Robin Hood on Halloween but everyone thought he was Peter Pan.) "I've got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it."
                    "If that's a working stethoscope then maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat."
                    (Trying to hit on Summer Glau; Raj later stole this line) "It's hot in here, must be Summer."
                    "Are you from Mars? Cause your ass is out of this world."
                    "Your ass must be jelly cause jam doesn't shake like that."
                    He's also called Penny a "cheesecake-scented goddess".
                    Howard, Raj, Leonard and Sheldon are the only characters of the current main cast who have appeared in every episode (not counting the Unaired Pilot).
                    Howard Knows ASL.
                    Howard's Right-handed.
                    Howard's Jewish.
                    He once dropped Raj's phone in a urinal.
                    He once sold his sperm, as shown in the episode "The Classified Materials Turbulence" when Raj asks, "Have you been selling your sperm again?
                    Howard's called Wasserman in "The Rhinitis Revelation".
                    Though he's seen drinking alcohol like the others numerous times, Howard's the only main character to never have been shown very intoxicated.
                    Howard appears to be inspired by the character Seth from Joey, the sequel to Friends also made by Warner Bros with the following similarities: both Seth and Howard are depicted with geeky personalities; Seth shares a friendship with Michael Tribbiani similar to Howard's with Raj, though Seth is sometimes shown to be Michael's rival; and during a double date party, Seth attends with a girl named Molly, who displays many similar traits to Bernadette, most notably a high pitched voice.
